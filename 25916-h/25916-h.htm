<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>JERNYNGHAM&#8217;S HAPPY THOUGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>The air was cooling down toward evening at Sebastian,
where an unpicturesque collection of wooden
houses stand upon a branch line on the Canadian prairie.
The place is not attractive during the earlier portion of
the short northern summer, when for the greater part of
every week it lies sweltering in heat, in spite of the
strong west winds that drive dust-clouds through its
rutted streets. As a rule, during the remaining day or
two the temperature sharply falls, thunder crashes between
downpours of heavy rain, and the wet plank
sidewalks provide a badly-needed refuge from the cement-like
&#8220;gumbo&#8221; mire.
</p>
<p>The day, however, had been cloudless and unusually
hot. Prescott had driven in from his wheat farm at some
distance from the settlement, and he now walked toward
the hotel. He was twenty-eight years old, of average
height and rather spare figure; his face, which had been
deeply bronzed by frost and sun, was what is called
open, his gray eyes were clear and steady, the set of
his lips and mould of chin firm. He looked honest
and good-natured, but one who could, when necessary,
sturdily hold his own. His attire was simple: a wide
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
gray hat, a saffron-colored shirt with flannel collar,
and a light tweed suit, something the worse for wear.
</p>
<p>As he passed along the sidewalk he looked about.
The small, frame houses were destitute of paint and any
pretense of beauty, a number of them had raised, square
fronts which hid the shingled roofs; but beyond the end
of the street there was the prairie stretching back to the
horizon. In the foreground it was a sweep of fading
green and pale ocher; farther off it was tinged with gray
and purple; and where it cut the glow of green and pink
on the skyline a long birch bluff ran in a cold blue smear.
To the left of the opening rose three grain elevators: huge
wooden towers with their tops narrowed in and devices of
stars and flour-bags painted on them. At their feet ran
the railroad track, encumbered with a string of freight-cars;
a tall water-tank, a grimy stage for unloading coal,
and a small office shack marked the station.
</p>
<p>Prescott, however, did not notice much of this; he was
more interested in the signs of conflict on the persons of
the men he met. Some looked as if they had been violently
rolled in the dust; others wore torn jackets; and the
faces of several were disfigured by bruises. Empty bottles,
which make handy clubs, were suggestively scattered
about the road. All this was unusual, but Prescott supposed
some allowance must be made for the fact that it
was the anniversary of the famous victory of the Boyne.
Moreover, there was a community of foreign immigrants,
mixed with some Irishmen and French Canadians, but all
professing the Romish faith, engaged in some railroad
work not far away.
</p>
<p>In front of the hotel ran a veranda supported on wooden
pillars, and a row of chairs was set out on the match-strewn
sidewalk beneath it. Most of them were occupied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
by after-supper loungers, and several of the men bore
scars. Prescott stopped and lighted his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Things seem to have been pretty lively here,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;I came in to see the implement man and found
he couldn&#8217;t talk straight, with half his teeth knocked out.
It&#8217;s lucky the Northwest troopers have stopped your carrying
pistols.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One of the men laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a great day, sure. Quite a few of the
Dagos had knives, and Jernyngham had a sword.
Guess he&#8217;d be in trouble now, only it wasn&#8217;t one you
could cut with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did he get the sword?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was King Billy&#8217;s,&#8221; explained another man. &#8220;Fellow
who was acting him got knocked out with a bottle
in his eye. Jernyngham got up on the horse instead
and led the last charge, when we whipped them across
the track.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the Protestant Old Guard now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of it&#8217;s in Clayton&#8217;s surgery; rest&#8217;s gone home.
When it looked as if the stores would be wrecked, Reeve
Marvin butted in. Telephoned the railroad boss to send
up gravel cars for his boys; told the other crowd he&#8217;d
bring the troopers in if they didn&#8217;t quit. Ordered all
strangers off on the West-bound, and now we&#8217;re simmering
down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Jernyngham?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man jerked his hand toward the hotel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In his room, a bit the worse for wear. Mrs. Jernyngham&#8217;s
nursing him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pushing open the wire-mesh mosquito door, Prescott
entered the building. Its interior was shadowy and filled
with cigar smoke; flies buzzed everywhere, and the smell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
of warm resinous boards pervaded the rank atmosphere.
The place was destitute of floor covering or drapery, and
the passage Prescott walked down was sloppy with soap
and water from a row of wash-basins, near which hung one
small wet towel. Ascending the stairs, he entered a little
and very scantily furnished room with walls of uncovered
pine. It contained a bed with a ragged quilt and a couple
of plain wooden chairs, in one of which a man leaned back.
He was about thirty years old and he roughly resembled
Prescott, only that his face, which was a rather handsome
one, bore the stamp of indulgence. His forehead was
covered by a dirty bandage, there was dust on his clothes,
and Prescott thought he was not quite sober. In the
other chair sat a young woman with fine dark eyes and
glossy black hair, whose appearance would have been
prepossessing had it not been spoiled by her slatternliness
and cheap finery. She smiled at the visitor as he
walked in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d come sooner, we might have kep&#8217; him out
o&#8217; trouble,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He got away from me when
things begun to hum.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her slight accent suggested the French Canadian strain,
though Prescott imagined that there was a trace of Indian
blood in her. Her manners were unfinished, her character
was primitive, but Prescott thought she was as
good a consort as Jernyngham deserved. The latter
had a small wheat farm lying back on the prairie, but
his erratic temperament prevented his successfully working
it. Prescott was not a censorious person, and he
had a liking and some pity for the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, in answer to the woman&#8217;s remark,
&#8220;that was certainly foolish of him. But what had he
to do with the row, anyway?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have a drink, and I&#8217;ll try to explain,&#8221; said Jernyngham.
&#8220;A big cool drink might clear my head, and I
feel it needs it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You kin have soda, but nothin&#8217; else!&#8221; the woman
broke in. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send it up; and now that I kin leave you,
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to the store.&#8221; She turned to Prescott. &#8220;Nothin&#8217;
but soda; and see he don&#8217;t git out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She left them and Jernyngham laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ellice&#8217;s a good sort; I sometimes wonder how she
puts up with me. Anyhow, I&#8217;m glad you came, because
I&#8217;m in what might be called a dilemma.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As this was not a novelty to his companion, Prescott
made no comment, and by and by two tumblers containing
iced liquid were brought in. Jernyngham drained
his thirstily and looked up with a grin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t exhilarating, but it&#8217;s cool,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now,
however, you&#8217;re curious about my honorable scars&mdash;I
got them from a bottle. It broke, you see, but there&#8217;s
some satisfaction in remembering that I knocked out the
other fellow with the flat of the Immortal William&#8217;s sword.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get worse hurt some day,&#8221; Prescott rebuked
him severely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible, but you&#8217;re wandering from the point.
I&#8217;m trying to remember what led me into the fray in the
incongruous company of certain Hardshell Baptists,
Ontario Methodists, and Belfast Presbyterians. As a
young man, my sympathies were with the advanced
Anglicans, perhaps because my people were sternly
Evangelical. Then the whole thing&#8217;s unreasonable&mdash;what
have I to do, for instance, with the Protestant
succession?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t very plain,&#8221; said Prescott. &#8220;Still, everybody
knows what kind of fool you are.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I live,&#8221; declared Jernyngham. &#8220;You steady, industrious
fellows grow. The row began at the ball-game&mdash;disputed
base, I think&mdash;and our lot had got
badly whipped at the first round when I stood on the
veranda and sang them, &#8216;No Surrender.&#8217; That was
enough for the Ulster boys, and three or four of them go
a long way in this kind of scrimmage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott had no sympathy with Jernyngham&#8217;s vagaries,
but one could not be angry with him: the man
was irresponsible. In a few moments, however, Jernyngham&#8217;s
face grew graver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;I&#8217;m in a hole. Never troubled
to ask for my letters until late in the afternoon, and now
I don&#8217;t know what to do unless you can help me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better tell me what the trouble is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To make you understand, I&#8217;ll have to go back some
time. Everybody round this place knows what I am
now, but I believe I was rather a promising youngster
before I left the old country, a bit of a rebel though,
and inclined to kick against the ultra-conventional.
In fact, I think honesty was my ruin, Jack; I kicked
openly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any other way? I can&#8217;t see that there&#8217;s
much use in kicking unless the opposition feels it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t interrupt,&#8221; scowled Jernyngham. &#8220;This is
rather deep for you, but I&#8217;ll try to explain. If you want
to get on in the old country, you must conform to the
standard; though you can do what you like at times and
places where people of your proper circle aren&#8217;t supposed
to see you. I didn&#8217;t recognize the benefits of the system
then&mdash;and I suffered for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused with a curious, half-tender look in his
face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There was a girl, Jack, good as they&#8217;re made, I still
believe, though not in our station. Well, I meant to
marry her&mdash;thought I was strong enough to defy the
system&mdash;and she, not knowing what manner of life I
was meant for, was fond of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What manner of life were you meant for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham laughed harshly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bar, for a beginning; I&#8217;d got my degree. The
House later&mdash;there was strong family influence&mdash;to
assist in propagating the Imperial idea. Strikes one as
amusing, Jack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott thought his companion would not have
spoken so freely had he been wholly sober, but he
had long noticed the purity of the man&#8217;s intonation
and the refinement that occasionally showed in his
manners.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re making quite a tale of it,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; resumed Jernyngham, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what
I was up against; the system broke me. When the stress
came, I hadn&#8217;t nerve enough to hold out, and for that
I&#8217;ve been punished. My sister&mdash;she meant well&mdash;got
hold of the girl, persuaded her to give me up&mdash;for my
sake, Jack. Wouldn&#8217;t see me, sent back my letters,
and I came to Canada, beaten.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a reason why you must try to realize my
father and sister. He&#8217;s unflinchingly upright, conventional
to a degree; Gertrude&#8217;s a feebler copy, as just,
but perhaps not quite so hard. Well, I&#8217;ve never written
to either, but I&#8217;ve heard from friends and the conclusion
seems to be that as I&#8217;ve never asked for money I must
have reformed. There&#8217;s a desire for a reconciliation;
my father&#8217;s getting old, and I believe, in their reserved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
way, they were fond of me. Don&#8217;t be impatient; I&#8217;m
coming to the point at last. I&#8217;d a letter to-day from
Colston&mdash;though the man&#8217;s a relative, I haven&#8217;t seen him
since I left school. He and his wife are passing through
on their way to British Columbia and the idea seems to
be that he should see me and report.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott made a sign of understanding. Jernyngham,
stamped with dissipation and injured in a brawl,
and his small homestead where everything was in disorder
and out of repair, were hardly likely to create a favorable
impression on his English relatives. Besides, there was
Mrs. Jernyngham. The effect of her appearance and
conversation might be disastrous.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; continued Jernyngham, &#8220;you see how I&#8217;m
fixed. I haven&#8217;t much to thank my people for, but I want
to spare them a shock. If it would make things easier for
them, I don&#8217;t mind their thinking better of me than I
deserve.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His companion pondered this. It was crudely put, but
it showed a rather fine consideration, Prescott thought,
for the people who were in part responsible for the
man&#8217;s downfall; perhaps, too, a certain sense of shame
and contrition. Jernyngham&#8217;s desire could not be found
fault with.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do about it?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Jernyngham with a reckless laugh.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll do all that&#8217;s needed; I mean to leave my
friends to you. Strikes me as a brilliant idea, though not
exactly novel; made a number of excellent comedies.
Did you ever see &#8216;Charley&#8217;s Aunt&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott frowned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t deal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think! You&#8217;re not unlike me and we&#8217;re about the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
same age; Colston, hasn&#8217;t seen me for fourteen years;
his wife never!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; objected Prescott. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be done!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hardly good form to remind you of it, Jack, but
there was a time when we took a grading contract on the
line and you got into trouble close in front of the ballast
train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott&#8217;s determined expression changed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he conceded; &#8220;it gives you a pull on me&mdash;I
can&#8217;t go back on that.&#8221; He spread out his hands. &#8220;Well,
if you insist.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For the old man&#8217;s sake,&#8221; said Jernyngham. &#8220;I
want you to take the Colstons out to your place and
entertain them for a day or two; they won&#8217;t stay long.
They&#8217;re coming in by the West-bound this evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; exclaimed Prescott, &#8220;they&#8217;ll be here in half an
hour, if the train&#8217;s on time! If there are any points you
can give me about your family history, you had better be
quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, I was rather a wild youngster, with
an original turn of mind and was supposed to be a bit
of a rake, though that wasn&#8217;t correct&mdash;my eccentricities
were harmless then. Your word &#8216;maverick&#8217; describes
me pretty well: I didn&#8217;t belong to the herd; I wouldn&#8217;t
be rounded up with the others and let them put the brand
on. That&#8217;s no doubt why they credited me with vices I
didn&#8217;t possess.&#8221; Jernyngham laughed. &#8220;Still, you
mustn&#8217;t overdo the thing; you want delicately to convey
the idea that you&#8217;re now reformed. The part requires
some skill; it&#8217;s a pity you&#8217;re not smarter. Jack. But let
me think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went into a few details about his family, and then
Prescott left him and, after giving an order to have his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
team ready, proceeded to the station. It was getting
dark, but the western sky was still a sheet of wonderful
pale green, against which the tall elevators stood out
black and sharp. The head-lamp of a freight locomotive
flooded track and station with a dazzling electric glare,
the rails that ran straight and level across the waste
gleaming far back in the silvery radiance. This helped
Prescott to overcome his repugnance to his task, as he
remembered another summer night when he had attempted
to hurry his team across the track before a
ballast train came up. Startled by the blaze of the head-lamp
and the scream of the whistle, one of the horses
plunged and kicked; a wheel of the wagon, sinking in
the loose ballast, skidded against a tie; and Prescott
stood between the rails, struggling to extricate the beasts,
while the great locomotive rushed down on them. There
was a vein of stubborn tenacity in him and it looked as
if he and the horses would perish together when Jernyngham
came running to the rescue. How they escaped
neither of them could afterward remember, but a moment
later they stood beside the track while the train went
banging by, covering them with dust and fragments of
gravel. Prescott admitted that he owed Jernyngham
something for that.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless there was no doubt that the part he had
undertaken to play would be difficult. He could see its
humorous side, but he had not been a prodigal; indeed
he was by temperament and habit steady-going and industrious.
The son of a small business man in Montreal,
he had after an excellent education abandoned city life
and gone west, where he had prospered by frugality and
hard work. He was by no means rich, but he was
content and inclined to be optimistic about the future.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>When he reached the station, he found that the usual
crowd of loungers had gathered to watch the train come
in. Lighting his pipe, he walked up and down the low
platform, wondering uneasily how he would get through
the next few days. Jernyngham, he felt, had placed him
in a singularly embarrassing position.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>MURIEL SEES THE WEST</h3>
</div>

<p>The sunlight was fading off the prairie when a party
of three sat in a first-class car as the local train went
jolting westward. Henry Colston leaned back in his
seat with a Winnipeg paper on his knee; and his appearance
stamped him as a well-bred Englishman traveling
for pleasure. He was thirty-four; his dress, though
dusty, was fastidiously neat; his expression was pleasant,
but there was an air of formality about him. One would
not have expected him to do anything startling or extravagant,
even under stress of emotion. Mrs. Colston
resembled him in this respect. She was a handsome
woman, a little reserved in manner, and was tastefully
dressed in traveling tweed, which she had found too hot
for the Canadian summer. Muriel, her sister, was twenty-four,
and though the two were alike, the girl&#8217;s face was
fresher, more ingenuous and perhaps more intelligent.
It was an attractive face, crowned with red-gold hair;
broad brows, straight nose and firm mouth hinted at
some force of character, but her eyes of deep violet were
unusually merry, and her warm coloring suggested a
sanguine temperament.
</p>
<p>So far, Muriel Hurst had taken life lightly and had
foiled Mrs. Colston&#8217;s attempts to make a suitable match
for her. The daughter of a man of taste who had died in
difficulties, she had not a penny beyond the allowance
provided by her sister&#8217;s generosity. Nevertheless, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
was happy and had a strong liking and respect for her
prosperous brother-in-law, though his restricted views
sometimes irritated her.
</p>
<p>She was now trying to arrange her impressions of
Canada, which were mixed. She had looked down on
Montreal with its great bridge and broad river from the
wooded mountain, and from there it had struck her as a
beautiful city. Then she had seen the handsome stone
houses with their lawns at the foot of the hill, and afterward
the magnificent commercial buildings round the
postoffice. These could scarcely be equaled in London,
but the rest of the town had not impressed her. It was
strewn with sand and cement-dust: they seemed to be
pulling down and putting up buildings and tearing open
the streets all over it.
</p>
<p>Afterward the Western Express had swept her through
a thousand miles of wilderness, a vast tract of forest
filled with rocks and lakes and rivers; and then she had
spent two days in Winnipeg on the verge of the prairie.
This city she found perplexing. The station hall was
palatial, part of wide Main Street and Portage Avenue
with their stately banks and offices could hardly be too
much admired, and there were pretty wooden houses
running back to the river among groves of trees. But
apart from this, the place was somehow primitive. There
were numerous hard-faced men hanging about the streets,
and it jarred on her to see the rows of well-dressed
loungers in the hotels lolling in wooden chairs close
against the great windows, a foot or two from the street.
It gave her a hint of western characteristics; the people
were abrupt, good-naturedly so, perhaps, but devoid of
delicacy.
</p>
<p>Last had come the prairie&mdash;the land of promise&mdash;which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
seemed to run on forever, flooded with brilliant
sunshine under a sky of dazzling blue. Banded with
miles of wheat, flecked with crimson flowers, it stretched
back, brightly green, until it grew gray and blue on the
far horizon. It was relieved by the neutral purple of
poplar bluffs, and little gleaming lakes; its vastness and
openness filled the girl with a sense of liberty. Narrow
restraints, cramping prejudices, must vanish in this wide
country; one&#8217;s nature could expand and become optimistic
here.
</p>
<p>Then Colston began to talk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We should arrive in the next half-hour and I&#8217;ll confess
to a keen curiosity about Cyril Jernyngham. He was an
amusing and eccentric scapegrace when I last saw him,
though that is a very long time ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You object to eccentricity, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; laughed
Muriel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Call it originality, and I&#8217;ll admit that a
certain amount is useful; but it should be kept in check.
Indulged in freely, it&#8217;s apt to rouse suspicion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is rather unfair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Mrs. Colston broke in. &#8220;Considered
all round, it&#8217;s an excellent rule that if you won&#8217;t do
what everybody in your station does, you must take the
consequences.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colston nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree. One must think of the results to society
as a whole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyril Jernyngham seems to have taken the consequences,&#8221;
Muriel pointed out. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there something
to be said for the person who does so uncomplainingly?
I understand he never recanted or asked for help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Colston shot a quick glance at her. She did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
wish her sister&#8217;s sympathy to be enlisted on the black
sheep&#8217;s behalf.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that&#8217;s true,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s
hardly to his credit. His father is an old man who had
expected great things of him. If he had come home, he
would have been forgiven and reinstated.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Colston, &#8220;though Jernyngham seldom
shows his feelings, I know he has grieved over his son.
There can be no question that Cyril should have returned;
I&#8217;ve told him so in my letters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose they&#8217;d have insisted on a full and abject
surrender?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not an abject one,&#8221; answered Colston. &#8220;He would
have been expected to fall in with the family ideas and
plans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And he wouldn&#8217;t?&#8221; suggested Muriel with a mischievous
smile. &#8220;I think he was right.&#8221; Reading disapproval
in her sister&#8217;s expression, she continued: &#8220;You
dear virtuous people are a little narrow in your ideas;
you can&#8217;t understand that there&#8217;s room for the greatest
difference of opinion even in a harmonious family, and
that it&#8217;s very silly to drive the nonconformer into
rebellion. Variety&#8217;s a law of nature and tends to life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colston glanced meaningly at his wife. He was not a
hypercritical person, but it did not please him that his
sister-in-law, of whom he was fond, should champion
Jernyngham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to be severe on Cyril,&#8221; he rejoined. &#8220;As
a matter of fact, I know nothing good or bad about his
Canadian life; but he must be regarded as, so to speak,
on probation until he has proved that he deserves our
confidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel made no answer. She was looking out of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
window toward the west, and the glow on the vast plain&#8217;s
rim seized her attention. The sunset flush had faded,
but the sky shone a transcendent green. The air was very
clear; every wavy line of bluff was picked out in a wonderful
deep blue. Muriel thought she had never seen such
strength and vividness of color. Then she glanced round
the long car. It was comfortable except for the jolting;
the silvery gray of its cane-backed seats contrasted with
the paneling of deep brown. The big lamps and metal
fittings gleamed with nickel. All the girl saw connected
her with luxurious civilization, and she wondered with
a stirring of curiosity what awaited her in the wilds,
where man still grappled with nature in primitive fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sebastian in three or four minutes!&#8221; announced the
conductor; and while Muriel and Mrs. Colston gathered
together a few odds and ends a scream of the whistle
broke out.
</p>
<p>Prescott heard it on the station platform and with
strong misgivings braced himself for his task. A bright
light was speeding down the track, blending with that
flung out by a freight locomotive crossing the switches.
Then amid the clangor of the bell the long cars rolled in
and he saw a man standing on the platform of one.
There was no doubt that he was an Englishman and
Prescott hurried toward the car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Henry Colston?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>The man held out his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Harry is sufficient. Come and speak to
Florence; she has been looking forward to meeting you
with interest.&#8221; He turned. &#8220;My dear, this is Cyril.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott shook hands with the lady on the car platform,
and then looked past her in confused surprise. A girl
stood in the vestibule, clad in garments of pale lilac tint
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
which fell about her figure in long sweeping lines, emphasizing
its fine contour against the dark brown paneling.
She had a large hat of the same color, and it enhanced
the attractiveness of her face, which wore a
friendly smile. She was obviously one of the party,
though Jernyngham had not mentioned her, and Prescott
pulled himself together when Colston presented him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My sister-in-law, Muriel Hurst,&#8221; he added.
</p>
<p>When they had alighted, Prescott asked for the checks
and moved toward the baggage car. While he waited,
watching the trunks being flung out, Ellice passed him
talking to a smartly dressed man. This struck Prescott
as curious, but he knew the man as a traveling salesman
for an American cream-separator, and as he must have
called at Jernyngham&#8217;s homestead on his round and was
no doubt leaving by the train, there was no reason why
Ellice should not speak to him. He thought no more of
the matter and proceeded to carry several trunks and
valises across the platform to his wagon, while his new
friends watched him with some surprise. It was a novel
experience in their walk of life to see their host carrying
their baggage, and when Prescott lifted the heaviest
trunk Colston hurried forward to protest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand aside, please,&#8221; said the rancher, walking firmly
across the boards with the big trunk on his shoulders.
When he had placed it in the wagon he turned to the
ladies with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had thought of putting you up for the night at the
hotel, but they&#8217;re full, and with good luck we ought to
make my place in about three hours. I dare say this
isn&#8217;t the kind of rig you have been accustomed to driving
in; and somebody will have to sit on a trunk. There&#8217;s
only room for three on the driving-seat.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Colston surveyed the vehicle with misgivings.
It was a long, shallow box set on four tall and very light
wheels, and crossed by a seat raised on springs. Two
rough-coated horses were harnessed to it with a pole
between them. She saw this by the glare of the freight
locomotive&#8217;s head-lamp when the train moved out, and
noticed that her husband was looking at their host in
surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the trunk,&#8221; said Colston. &#8220;We had dinner
down the line not long ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott helped the ladies up and seating himself next
to the younger started his horses. They set off at a rapid
trot and the wagon jolted unpleasantly as it crossed the
track. Then the horses broke into a gallop, raising a
dust-cloud in the rutted street, while the light vehicle
rocked in an alarming fashion, and Prescott had some
trouble in restraining them when they ran out on to the
dim waste of prairie. Then the wonderful keen air,
faintly scented with wild peppermint, reacted upon the
girl with a curious exhilarating effect. She felt stirred
and excited, expectant of new experiences, perhaps
adventures. The wild barley brushed about the wheels
with a silky rustle; the beat of hoofs rang in a sharp
staccato through the deep silence; and the touch of the
faint night wind brought warmth into Muriel&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re pretty fresh; been in the stable of a farm near
here most of the day,&#8221; Prescott explained. &#8220;Not long
off the range, anyhow, and they&#8217;re bad to hold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a shrill scream from a dusky shape flitting
through the air as they skirted a marshy pool, and the
team again broke into a furious gallop. The trail was
grown with short scrub which smashed beneath the hoofs,
and the vehicle lurched sharply when the wheels left the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
ruts and ran through tall, tangled grass. Prescott with
some diffidence slipped his arm round Muriel&#8217;s waist,
while Colston jolted up and down with his trunk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have still the same taste in horses, Cyril,&#8221; he
remarked. &#8220;I suppose you remember Wildfire?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wildfire?&#8221; queried Prescott, and then, having the
impression that young English lads were sometimes
given a pony, ventured: &#8220;Quite a cute little beast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Little!&#8221; exclaimed Colston. &#8220;How many hands
make a big horse in this country? I&#8217;m speaking of the
hunter you cajoled the second groom into saddling when
your father was away. Can&#8217;t you remember how you
insisted on putting her at the Newby brook?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to place it somehow,&#8221; said Prescott in
alarm, seeing that if he were called upon to share any
more reminiscences it might lead him into difficulties.
&#8220;You know I&#8217;ve been out here a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Long enough to forget, it seems.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott made a bold venture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so; perhaps it&#8217;s better. This is a brand new
country. One starts afresh here, looking forward instead
of back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel considered this. The idea was, she thought,
appropriate, but the man&#8217;s tone and air were not what
one would have expected of a reformed rake. There
was no hint of contrition; he spoke with optimistic
cheerfulness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Colston agreed. &#8220;I wonder if I might
say that you have grown more Canadian than I expected
to find you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;More Canadian?&#8221; Prescott checked himself in
time and laughed. &#8220;Is it surprising? You drive and
starve out many a good man who dares to be original&mdash;I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
met a number of them. Can you wonder that when
they&#8217;re welcomed here they&#8217;re willing to forget you and
become one with the people who took them in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way, that&#8217;s a pity,&#8221; said Mrs. Colston. &#8220;We
like to think we haven&#8217;t lost you altogether.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Disregarding his horses, Prescott turned toward her
with a bow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Face the truth, ma&#8217;am. If you&#8217;re ever in a tight
place, we&#8217;ll send you what help we can, hard men, such
as can&#8217;t be raised in your cities, to keep the flag flying,
but we stop there. Don&#8217;t think we belong to you&mdash;we
stand firm on our own feet, a new free nation. I&#8221;&mdash;he
paused in an impressive manner&mdash;&#8220;am a Canadian.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel felt a responsive thrill. His ideas were certainly
not English, nor was his mode of expressing them,
but his boldness appealed to her. Her companions were
frankly astonished and rather hurt, which he seemed to
realize, for he resumed with a laugh:
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we won&#8217;t talk politics. Things I&#8217;ve heard
English people say out here make one tired.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he turned toward the girl, adding softly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that a very bad break I made?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it could be forgiven,&#8221; she told him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The years you have spent in Canada seem to have
had their full effect on you,&#8221; Colston remarked dryly.
</p>
<p>Prescott turned his attention to his team, slightly
checking their pace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you mean when you said we should reach
your ranch in three hours, if we had good luck?&#8221; Muriel
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there are badger burrows about, and
a little beast called a gopher makes almost as bad a hole;
they&#8217;re fond of digging up the trail. If a horse steps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
into one of those holes, it&#8217;s apt to bring him down.
Besides, we trust a good deal to our luck in this country&mdash;one
has to run risks that can&#8217;t be estimated: harvest frost,
rust, dry seasons, winds that blow destroying sand about.
I&#8217;ve lost two crops in the eight years I&#8217;ve been here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can it be eight?&#8221; Colston broke in. &#8220;If I remember
right, you spent three years in Manitoba.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same kind of country and the same climate,&#8221;
Prescott rejoined, conscious that he had nearly betrayed
himself again. He felt angry with Jernyngham for
giving him such a difficult part to play.
</p>
<p>After this, he carefully avoided any personal topic and
talked about Canadian farming, sitting silent when he
could, while Muriel gazed about with pleasurable curiosity.
It is never quite dark on those wide levels in summertime,
and, for there was no moon, the prairie stretched
away before them shadowy, silent, and mysterious. Now
they passed a sheet of water, gleaming wanly among thin
willows; then they plunged into the deep gloom of a
poplar bluff; and later, lurching down a steep declivity,
swept through a shallow creek. The air was filled with
the smell of dew-damped soil and unknown aromatic
scents, the loneliness was impressive, the half-obscurity
emphasized the strangeness of everything. Muriel felt
as if she had left all that was stereotyped and matter-of-fact
far behind. It was the unexpected and romantic that
ought to happen in this virgin land.
</p>
<p>Then, worn by several days&#8217; journey in the jolting
cars, she grew drowsy. The steady drumming of hoofs,
the slapping of the traces, and the rattle of wheels were
strangely soothing. She fancied that once or twice when
they sped furiously down an incline, the driver held her
fast, but she did not resent the support of his arm: it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
a steady, reassuring grasp. At last, as they swung
round a poplar bluff, she roused herself, for dim black
buildings loomed up ahead, and one which had lighted
windows took the shape of a small house. The team
stopped, there were voices speaking with a curious accent
which reminded her of Norway, and the rancher helped
her down.
</p>
<p>Afterward she followed her sister into a simply furnished,
pine-boarded room with a big stove at one end of
it, where a middle-aged woman set food and coffee before
them. She spoke English haltingly, but her lined face
lighted up when Muriel thanked her in Norse. Then
there followed a flow of eager words, a few of which the
girl caught, until the woman broke off when their host
came in. He was silent, for the most part, during the
meal, and shortly afterward Muriel was shown into a
small room where she went to sleep in a few minutes.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>JERNYNGHAM MAKES A DECISION</h3>
</div>

<p>Prescott&#8217;s guests had spent a week at his homestead
with content when Colston and his wife sat
talking one morning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m frankly puzzled,&#8221; said Colston, opening his
cigar case; &#8220;I can&#8217;t make Cyril out. He&#8217;s frugal,
remarkably industrious&mdash;I think the description&#8217;s warranted&mdash;and,
from all that one can gather, as steady
as a rock. This, of course, is gratifying, but it&#8217;s by no
means what I expected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly doesn&#8217;t fit in with the picture his sister
Gertrude drew me, though she conveyed the impression
that she was softening things down. There can be no
doubt that he was wild. That might, perhaps, be
forgiven, but one or two of the stories I&#8217;ve heard about
him filled me with disgust.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her husband looked thoughtful. He had not noticed
that Muriel was sitting just outside the open window,
though Mrs. Colston, being in a different position, had
done so. She thought their voices would reach the girl,
and if anything strongly in Cyril&#8217;s disfavor cropped up
during the conversation it might be as well that she should
hear it. Mrs. Colston was willing that he should be
reconciled to his relatives, but a reformed rake was not
the kind of man to whom she wished her sister to be
attracted. One could not tell whether the reformation
would prove permanent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;After all, I never heard any really serious offense
proved against him,&#8221; Colston rejoined. &#8220;It&#8217;s sometimes
easy to acquire a reputation without doing anything
in particular to deserve it. People are apt to jump at
conclusions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When there&#8217;s a general concurrence of opinion it&#8217;s
wiser to fall in with it. But what did he say about his
father&#8217;s suggestion that he should go home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Asked for a day or two to think it over; I fancied that
he wished to consult somebody. Then he promised to
give me an answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the whole, I think they need have no hesitation
about taking him back now,&#8221; Mrs. Colston responded;
and Muriel agreed with her. &#8220;There&#8217;s another point,&#8221;
she added. &#8220;How long shall we stay here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve a growing liking for Cyril, the
place is pleasant, and though things are rather rudimentary,
the air&#8217;s wonderfully bracing. He urged me to
stay some little time, and I felt that he wished it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Colston considered. She was enjoying her visit;
everything was delightfully novel and she felt more
cheerful and more vigorous than she had done for some
time. But Muriel seemed to find the prairie pleasant,
and there was a possibility of danger there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We might, perhaps, remain another week,&#8221; she
suggested.
</p>
<p>As it happened, Colston&#8217;s suspicion that his host
wished to consult somebody was correct, for Prescott
was then driving in to the settlement to lay his visitor&#8217;s
message before the man it most concerned. He found
him lounging in the hotel bar, and, drawing him into the
general-room, he sat down opposite him in a hard wooden
chair. The apartment had no floor covering and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
cheerless and dirty; there was not even a table in it; and
only a railroad time-table and advertisements of land
sales hung on its rough pine walls. Jernyngham, however,
looked in keeping with his surroundings. The
dirty bandage still covered his forehead, his clothes were
stained and untidy, and he had an unkempt, dissipated air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he asked with a grin, &#8220;how are you getting on
with your new friends?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; I&#8217;m curious about what they think of
me. Anyway, I found the thing harder than I expected.
Why didn&#8217;t you tell me Mrs. Colston was bringing her
sister?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I ever heard she had one, I forgot it; suppose I
couldn&#8217;t have read the letter properly. What&#8217;s she like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Herself,&#8221; said Prescott. &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of anybody
we know I could compare her with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had endeavored to speak carelessly, but something
in his voice betrayed him and Jernyngham laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not surprising. If you want to play your part
properly, you had better make love to her. It&#8217;s what
would be expected of me, and it couldn&#8217;t do any harm,
because these people would very soon head you off.
Harry Colston&#8217;s sister-in-law would look for an assured
position and at least five thousand dollars a year. When
are they going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve asked them to stay a little longer and I think
they&#8217;ll agree. But that is not what I came to see you
about. Colston laid a proposition before me&mdash;you&#8217;re
formally invited to return home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On what terms?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott detailed them, watching his companion. The
latter sat silent for a minute or two, and then he said
slowly:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a handsome offer, but it was made under a mistake.
There&#8217;s no doubt that Colston was trusted with
powers of discretion. He must be satisfied with you&mdash;don&#8217;t
you feel complimented, Jack?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What I feel is outside the question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued Jernyngham thoughtfully, &#8220;I suppose
if I indulged in a spell of hard work in the open and
practised strict abstinence it might improve my appearance,
and I could, perhaps, keep out of Colston&#8217;s way, or
if needful, own up to the trick. The old man would hold
to his bargain: he&#8217;s that kind. It&#8217;s a strong temptation&mdash;you
see what I&#8217;d stand to gain&mdash;a liberal allowance, a life
that&#8217;s wildly luxurious by comparison with the one I&#8217;m
leading, the society of people of the stamp I&#8217;ve been
brought up among. Jack, I feel driven to the point of
yielding. But it&#8217;s a pity this offer has come too late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it too late?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think! Would it be fair to go? For a month or two
I might keep straight, then&mdash;I&#8217;ve tried to describe my
people&mdash;you can imagine their feelings at the inevitable
outbreak. Besides, there&#8217;s a more serious difficulty.&#8221;
Jernyngham&#8217;s tense face relaxed into a grim smile.
&#8220;Can you imagine Ellice an inmate of an English country
house, patronizing local charities, presiding over
prim garden parties? The idea&#8217;s preposterous! And
that&#8217;s not all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott knew little about England, but he could
imagine her making an undesirable sensation in Montreal
or Toronto.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You force me to ask something. Is she Mrs.
Jernyngham?&#8221; he said, hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to think so; there&#8217;s a doubt about the matter
now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;One would have imagined that was a point you would
have been sure about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understood her husband was dead when we were
married in Manitoba. She was a waitress in a second-rate
hotel; the brute had ill-used and deserted her. But
there&#8217;s now some reason to believe he&#8217;s farming in
Alberta. I haven&#8217;t made inquiries: I didn&#8217;t think it
would improve matters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott said nothing. In face of such a situation,
any remarks that he could make would be superfluous.
There was a long silence; and then Jernyngham spoke
again, slowly, but resolutely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see how it is, Jack&mdash;where my interest lies.
Against that, there&#8217;s the feelings of my father and sister
to consider. Then my reinstatement would have to be
bought by casting off the woman who has borne with
my failings and stuck to me pluckily. I haven&#8217;t sunk
quite so far as that. You&#8217;ll have to tell Colston that I&#8217;m
staying here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He got up and Prescott laid a hand on his arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard; but you&#8217;re doing the square thing, Cyril.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham shook off his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let us talk in that strain. Come and see Ellice
and try to amuse her. Don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s wrong with
the woman; she has been moody of late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must get back as soon as I can and I&#8217;ve some
business to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; acquiesced Jernyngham, walking with
him to the bar, which was the quickest way of leaving.
</p>
<p>On reaching it he turned and glanced about sardonically.
The room was dark, filled with flies, and evil
smelling, as well as thick with smoke; half a dozen,
untidy men leaned against the counter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What a set of loafing swine you are!&#8221; he coolly
remarked. &#8220;It&#8217;s not to the point that I&#8217;m no better, but
if any of you feel insulted, I&#8217;ll be happy to make what
I&#8217;ve said good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut it out, Cyril! Can&#8217;t have a circus here!&#8221; exclaimed
the bar-tender.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be afraid. They look pretty tame,&#8221;
Jernyngham rejoined, and going on to the door, shook
hands with Prescott.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Colston he has my last word,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Turning away, he proceeded to the untidy parlor where
he found Ellice dawdling over a paper. Her white
summer dress was stained in places and open at the neck,
where a button had come off. The short skirt displayed
a hole in one stocking and a shoe from which a strap had
been torn. Jernyngham leaned on the table regarding
her with a curious smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Jack come about?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To say my fastidious relatives want me to go home,
which would mean leaving you behind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked at him searchingly, and then laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you won&#8217;t go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the message I sent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ellice&#8217;s face softened, though there was a hint of
indecision in it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right, Cyril, only a bit of a fool.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A bit?&#8221; he said dryly. &#8220;I&#8217;m the whole blamed hog.
But enough of that. We&#8217;ll pull out for the homestead
to-morrow. I expect Wandle is robbing me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been robbin&#8217; you ever since you bought the ranch.
I don&#8217;t know why you stopped me from gettin&#8217; after him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He saves me trouble,&#8221; explained Jernyngham, and
they discussed the arrangements for their return.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>Prescott, arriving home, had a brief private interview
with Colston, who realized with some disappointment
that his errand had failed. Then the rancher harnessed
a fresh team and proceeded to a sloo where his Scandinavian
hired man was cutting prairie hay. An hour or
two later Muriel went out on the prairie and walked
toward a poplar bluff, in the shadow of which she gathered
ripe red saskatoons, and then sat down to look about.
</p>
<p>The dazzling blue of the sky was broken by rounded
masses of silver-edged clouds that drove along before a
fresh northwest breeze. Streaked by their speeding
shadows, the great plain stretched away, checkered by
ranks of marigolds and tall crimson flowers of the lily
kind that swayed as the rippling grasses changed color in
the wind. A mile or two distant stood the trim wooden
homestead, with a tall windmill frame near by, girt by
broad sweeps of dark-green wheat and oats. These
were interspersed with stretches of uncovered soil, glowing
a deep chocolate-brown, which Muriel knew was the
summer fallow resting after a cereal crop. Beyond the
last strip of rich color, there spread, shining delicately
blue, a great field of flax; and then the dusky green of
alfalfa and alsike for the Hereford cattle, standing knee-deep
in a flashing lake. The prairie, she thought, was
beautiful in summer; its wideness was bracing, one was
stirred into cheerfulness and bodily vigor by the rush of
its fresh winds. She felt that she could remain contentedly
at the homestead for a long time; and then her
thoughts centered on its owner.
</p>
<p>This was perhaps why she rose and strolled on toward
the sloo, though she would not acknowledge that she
actually wished to meet him. The man was something
of an enigma and therefore roused in her an interest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
which was stronger because of some of the things she had
heard to his discredit. Following the rows of wheelmarks,
she brushed through the wild barley, whose spiky
heads whipped her dress, passed a chain of glistening
ponds, a bluff wrapped in blue shadow, and finally
descended a long slope to the basin at its foot where the
melting snow had run in spring. Now it had dried and
was covered with tall grass which held many flowers and
fragrant wild peppermint.
</p>
<p>A team of horses and a tinkling mower moved through
its midst, and at one edge Prescott was loading the grass
into a wagon. Engrossed as he was in his task, he did
not notice her, and she stood a while watching him. He
wore no jacket; the thin yellow shirt, flung open at the
neck and tightly belted at the waist, and the brown duck
trousers, showed the lithe grace of his athletic figure.
His poise and swing were admirable, and he was working
with determined energy, his face and uncovered arms
the warm color of the soil.
</p>
<p>Muriel drew a little closer and he stopped on seeing her.
His brown skin was singularly clean, his eyes were clear
and steady, though they often gave a humorous twinkle.
If this man had ever been a rake, his reformation must
have been drastic and complete, because although she
had a very limited acquaintance with people of that sort,
it was reasonable to conclude that they must bear some
sign of indulgence or sensuality. The rancher had no
stamp of either.
</p>
<p>He showed his pleasure at her appearance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have had quite a walk,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you will
wait while I put up the load, I&#8217;ll take you back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel sat down and watched him fling the grass in
heavy forkfuls on to the growing pile, until at last he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
clambered up upon the frame supporting it and, pulling
some out and ramming the rest back, proceeded to excavate
a hollow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Making a nest for you,&#8221; he told her with a laugh.
&#8220;Now, if you&#8217;ll get up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While she mounted by the wheel he stood on the edge
of the wagon, leaning down toward her. There did not
seem to be much foothold, the grass looked slippery,
and the hollow he had made was beyond her reach, but
she seized the hand he held out and he swung her up.
For a moment his fingers pressed tightly upon her waist,
and then she was safe in the hollow, smiling at him
as he found a precarious seat on the rack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t see how you were going to get up, but
you didn&#8217;t hesitate,&#8221; he said with a soft laugh, when he
had started his team.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she smiled back at him. &#8220;Somehow you inspire
one with confidence. I didn&#8217;t think you would let me
fall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Curious, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She reclined in the recess among the grass, which yielded
to her limbs in a way that gave her a sense of voluptuous
ease. Her pose, although scarcely a conventional
one, showed to advantage the fine contour of her form;
and the lilac-tinted dress that flowed in classic lines about
her made a patch of cool restful color on the warm ocher
of her surroundings. It was easy to read the man&#8217;s
admiration in his glance, and she became suddenly filled
with mischievous daring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyril,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you are either an excellent actor, or
else&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been maligned. Is that what you meant?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think I did mean something of the kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m a very poor actor. That should settle the
question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wondered how you became so very Canadian,&#8221;
she said thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with the Canadians?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. I haven&#8217;t met very many yet, but on the
whole I&#8217;m favorably impressed by them. They&#8217;re direct,
blunt, perhaps less complex than we are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No trimmings,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;They don&#8217;t muss
up good material so that it can hardly be recognized.
You can tell what a man is when you see him or hear him
talk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Muriel argued. &#8220;I&#8217;ve an idea that
it might be difficult, even in Canada.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He let this pass.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of the country?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>She glanced round. It was late in the afternoon and
somewhat cooler than it had been. Half the plain lay
in shadow, but the light was curiously sharp. A clump
of ragged jack-pines stood on a sandhill miles away, and
a lake twinkled in the remote distance. The powerful
Clydesdale horses plodded through short crackling scrub;
a fine scent of wild peppermint floated about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she responded, &#8220;it&#8217;s delightful! And everybody&#8217;s
so energetic! You move with a spring and verve;
and I don&#8217;t hear any grumbling, though there seems to be
so much to do!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And to bear now and then: crops wiped out&mdash;I&#8217;ve
lost two of them. The work never slackens, except in
winter, when you sit shivering beside the stove, if you&#8217;re
not hauling in building logs or cordwood through the
arctic frost. At night it&#8217;s deadly silent, unless there&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
blizzard howling; the plains are very lonely when the
snow lies deep. Don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;re better off in
England, taking it all &#8217;round?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laid respectful fingers on the hem of her skirt,
touching the fine material, as if appraising its worth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our wheat-growers&#8217; wives and daughters are lucky
if they&#8217;ve a couple of moderately smart dresses, but I
suppose you have several trunks full of things like this.
That and the kind of life it implies must count for
something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I have,&#8221; said Muriel with candor, answering
his steady inquiring glance. &#8220;Still, I&#8217;ve felt that we drift
along from amusement to amusement in a purposeless
way, doing nothing that&#8217;s worth while. There might
come a time when one would grow very tired of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must come and bring trouble then. Here one goes
on from task to task, each one bigger and more venturesome
than the last; acre added to acre, a gasoline tractor
to the horse-plow, another quarter-section broken.
Mind and body taxed all day and often half the night.
One can&#8217;t sit down and mope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was, she thought, a curious speech for a man who
had been described as careless, extravagant, and dissolute;
but he was getting too serious, and she laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were energetic enough in England, if reports are
true. I&#8217;ve often thought of your right-of-way adventure.
It must have been very dramatic when you appeared at
the garden party covered with fresh tar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like that, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he cautiously agreed.
&#8220;How do they tell the tale?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something like this&mdash;you were at the Hall with
Geoffrey when the townspeople were clamoring about
Sir Gilbert&#8217;s closing the path through the wood, and for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
some reason you assisted them in attacking the barricade.
It had been well tarred as a defensive measure, hadn&#8217;t
it? Then you returned, triumphant, black from head
to foot, when you thought the guests had gone, and
plunged into the middle of the last of them&mdash;Maud always
laughs when she talks about it. Sir Gilbert was somewhere
out of sight when you related the rabble&#8217;s brilliant
victory, but he dashed out red in face when he understood
and never stopped until he jumped into his motor. I
don&#8217;t think Geoffrey&#8217;s wife has forgiven you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I must have grown very staid since
then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel changed the subject, but they talked with much
good-humor until they reached the homestead, where the
man alighted and held out his arms to her. She hesitated
a moment, and then was seized by him and swung gently
to the ground, but she left him with a trace of heightened
color in her face and went quietly into the house.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>MURIEL FEELS REGRET</h3>
</div>

<p>It was pleasantly cool in the shadow of Jernyngham&#8217;s
wooden barn, where Prescott sat, talking to its owner.
Outside the strip of shade, the sun fell hot upon the
parched grass, and the tall wheat that ran close up to the
homestead swayed in waves of changing color before the
rush of breeze. The whitened, weather-worn boards of
the house, which faced the men, seemed steeped in glowing
light, and sounds of confused activity issued from the
doorway that was guarded by mosquito-netting. A
clatter of domestic utensils indicated that Ellice was
baking, and she made more noise than she usually did
when she was out of temper. Jernyngham listened with
faint amusement as he filled his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry I can&#8217;t ask you in, Jack,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
kitchen is a pretty large one, but when Ellice starts
bread-making, there isn&#8217;t a spot one can sit down in.
Of course, we&#8217;ve another living-room&mdash;I furnished it
rather nicely&mdash;but for some reason we seldom use it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The mosquito door swung back with a crash and Ellice
appeared in the entrance with a hot, angry face, and
hands smeared with dough, her hair hanging partly
loose in disorder about her neck, her skirt ungracefully
kilted up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you goin&#8217; to bring that water? Have I got to
wait another hour?&#8221; she cried, ignoring Prescott.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>Jernyngham rose and moved away. Returning, he
disappeared into the kitchen with a dripping pail and
Ellice&#8217;s voice was raised in harsh upbraiding. Then the
man came out, looking a trifle weary, though he sat down
by Prescott with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These things should be a warning, Jack,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Still, one has to make allowances; this hot weather&#8217;s
trying, and Ellice got a letter that disturbed her by the
last mail. I didn&#8217;t hear what was in it, but I suspect it
was a bill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott nodded, because he did not know what to say.
Mrs. Jernyngham had, he gathered, been unusually
fractious for the last week or two, and Cyril was invariably
forbearing. Indeed, Prescott sometimes wondered at his
patience, for he imagined that his comrade had outgrown
what love he had borne her. The man had his virtues:
he was rash, but he seldom failed to face the consequences
with whimsical good-humor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friends are going to-morrow,&#8221; Prescott told
him. &#8220;They understand that you will write home and
explain your reasons for remaining.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ll have to do so, though it will be difficult.
You see, to give the reasons that count most would be
cruel. If it&#8217;s any comfort to my folks to think favorably
of me, I&#8217;d rather let them. I&#8217;ve made a horrible mess of
things, but that&#8217;s no reason why others should suffer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott glanced round at the dilapidated house, the
untidy stable, the door of which was falling to pieces,
and the wagon standing with a broken wheel. There
was no doubt that Jernyngham was right in one respect.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; Cyril resumed, &#8220;your manner gives me the
impression that you&#8217;ll be sorry to lose your visitors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be sorry. I pressed them to stay and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
think they&#8217;d have done so, only that Mrs. Colston was
against it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! That strikes me as significant. You see, I can
make a good guess at her motives; I&#8217;ve suffered from that
kind of thing. She evidently considers you dangerous.
Don&#8217;t you feel flattered?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Colston has no cause for uneasiness; I could
wish she had.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m glad my friends are going. It will save
you trouble, Jack. A match between Miss Hurst and
you is out of the question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve felt that, so far as my merits go, which is the
best way I can put it,&#8221; said Prescott gravely. &#8220;You
speak as if there were stronger reasons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are; I&#8217;m a little surprised you don&#8217;t see them.
Your merits&mdash;I suppose you mean your character and
appearance&mdash;should go a long way; we&#8217;ll admit that
you&#8217;re a man who might have some attraction for even
such a girl as Miss Hurst seems to be, if she didn&#8217;t pause
to think. Unfortunately for you, however, it&#8217;s her duty
to her relatives to make a brilliant match and I&#8217;ve no
doubt she recognizes it. Girls of her station&mdash;you had
better face the truth, Jack&mdash;never marry beneath them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But a man may.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A fair shot,&#8221; laughed Jernyngham. &#8220;I can&#8217;t resent
it. But the man generally suffers, and the price is a
heavier one when the girl has to pay. There&#8217;s a penalty
for breaking caste.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to tolerate worse things in the old country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not often, after all&mdash;you hear of the flagrant offenders,
and though I dare say there are others who are not
found out, the bulk against whom there&#8217;s no reproach,
excite no attention. But we&#8217;ll let that go. I want you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
to understand. You&#8217;re right, Jack; it&#8217;s your position
that&#8217;s all wrong. Girls of the kind we&#8217;re considering are
brought up in luxury, taught every accomplishment
that&#8217;s economically useless, led to believe that every
comfort they need will somehow be supplied. They&#8217;re
charming in their proper environment, but it&#8217;s a cruelty
to take them out of it. They&#8217;d be helpless in this grim
country, where you must work for all you want and do
without many things even then. Can you imagine Miss
Hurst standing over a hot stove all day and spending her
evenings mending your worn-out shirts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott looked up, his face set hard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have said enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was silence after this, until a big man dressed
in old brown overalls stopped his horse near-by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve fixed up with Farrer to send over his gasoline
tractor to do the fall breaking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Saw the
telephone construction people yesterday and told them
I&#8217;d let them have two teams to haul in their poles. It&#8217;s
going to pay us better than keeping them for plowing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right, Wandle,&#8221; replied Jernyngham, and the
fellow nodded to Prescott and rode away.
</p>
<p>He lived on the next half-section and assisted Jernyngham
in the management of his ranch, besides sharing the
cost of labor, implements and horses with him, though
Prescott had cause for believing that the arrangement was
not to his friend&#8217;s benefit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be better off if you didn&#8217;t work with that
man,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible,&#8221; Jernyngham agreed. &#8220;I know he
robs me, but he saves me bother. Besides, if we decided
to separate and came to a settlement, I dare say he would
claim that I was in his debt; and he might be right. I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
no good at business. Ranching I don&#8217;t mind, but I
could never learn how to buy and sell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very useful ability,&#8221; Prescott rejoined with
some dryness. &#8220;But as I want to be home for supper,
I must get on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He unhitched his horse and mounted, and Jernyngham
walked with him to the gate in the wire fence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll remember what I told you, Jack,&#8221; he said
meaningly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Prescott answered with a stern face. &#8220;I suppose
I ought to thank you. I&#8217;m not likely to forget.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He rode home and arriving in time for supper took his
place at the table with mixed feelings, foremost among
which was keen regret. Except for the company of his
Scandinavian hired man and the latter&#8217;s hard-featured
wife, he had lived alone in Spartan simplicity, thinking
of nothing but his farm; and his guests&#8217; arrival had
revealed to him the narrowness of his life. They had
brought him new desires and thoughts, besides recalling
ideas he had long forgotten, and among other things had
made the evening meal a pleasant function to be looked
forward to, instead of an opportunity for hurriedly
consuming needed food.
</p>
<p>The spotless cloth and the flowers on the table were
novelties, but they pleased his eye. Colston with his
cheerful, well-bred air and fastidiousness in dress, talked
interestingly; Mrs. Colston with her gracious dignity,
and Muriel, who was wholly alluring, seemed to fill the
room with charm. It was perhaps all the more enjoyable
because Prescott had been accustomed to pleasant
society in Montreal, before he abandoned it with other
amenities and went out to a life of stern toil and frugality
in the grim Northwest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>He said little, though it was the last time they would
gather tranquilly round his board&mdash;they were to leave for
the railroad early on the morrow. A heavy melancholy
oppressed him, though bright sunlight streamed into the
room and an invigorating breeze swept in through the
open window, outside which tall wheat and blue flax rolled
away. He could not force himself to talk, though he
laughed at Colston&#8217;s anecdotes, and it was a relief when
the meal was over. Half an hour later he overtook
Muriel strolling along the edge of the wheat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you recovered yet?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;You looked
very downcast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how I feel. It strikes me as perfectly natural.
I&#8217;ll be alone to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you were alone before we came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very true; I didn&#8217;t seem to mind it then. I was
happy thinking how I could put in a bigger crop or raise
another bunch of stock. My mind was fixed on the
plow. But you have lifted me out of the furrow. I guess
it&#8217;s weak, but somehow I hate the thought of going back
to the clods.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Remembering Jernyngham&#8217;s remarks, it struck him
that this was not the line he should have taken, and for
a moment or two Muriel turned her head. Then she
looked at him, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be very sorry to leave, and I believe Florence
and Harry feel the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are going to British Columbia and down
the Pacific Coast. You will revel in new experiences and
interesting sights.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; she answered, rather listlessly. &#8220;We
shall get a glimpse of a new country, but that will be all.
On the steamers we&#8217;ll meet much the kind of people we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
are accustomed to, and no doubt we&#8217;ll stay at hotels built
especially for luxurious tourists. You see, we take our
usual environment along with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t that what you like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; perhaps it ought to be.&#8221; Muriel
paused and looked up at him with candid eyes. &#8220;You
hinted that we had given you a new and wider outlook&mdash;or
brought back the one you used to have, which is what
you must have meant. You don&#8217;t seem to realize that
you have done much the same thing to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t be difficult. You know the kind of
people I have hitherto met, and how we spend our time
in a round of amusements that lead to nothing, with all
that could jar on one carefully kept away. This is the first
time I&#8217;ve come into touch with strenuous, normal life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it doesn&#8217;t seem to have frightened you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said with a smile; &#8220;I&#8217;m not in the least
afraid&mdash;why should I be? I must have more courage
than you think, but does one need a great deal of it to
live here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked at her in grave admiration. There was a
hint of pride in her pose, and her eyes were calm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe if ever a time of stress came, you wouldn&#8217;t
shrink. But this is a pretty hard and lonely country,
especially in winter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel changed the subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For all that, I feel you are right in staying, Cyril.
Have you written to your people?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott felt embarrassed and guilty, as he generally
did when, in confidential moments, she called him by
Jernyngham&#8217;s name. Somehow he could not imagine
her saying Jack.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he rejoined slowly. &#8220;Of course, they must be
written to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel did not answer. The turn their conversation
had taken had filled her with a vague unrest as she looked
back at the life she had led. Three or four years ago it
had seemed filled with glamour and excitement, and she
had entered on its pleasures with eager zest, but of late
she had begun to find them wearisome. They no longer
satisfied her. If this were the result of a few years&#8217;
experience, what would she feel when she had grown
jaded with time and everything was stale? Then her
glimpse of the simple, healthful western life had come as
a revelation. It was real, a bracing struggle, in which
no effort was wasted but produced tangible results: broad
stretches of splendid wheat, sweeps of azure flax.
</p>
<p>But this was not all. She felt drawn to her brown-faced
companion, who had obviously redeemed whatever
errors he had been guilty of in the past. She had
known him for only about a fortnight, but she had seen
his admiration for her with a satisfaction that was slightly
tempered by misgivings. She could not tell exactly
what she expected from him, but she had at least looked
for some expression of a wish that their acquaintance
should not end abruptly on the morrow. She did not
think she would have resented a carefully modified display
of the gallantry Cyril Jernyngham must be capable
of, if reports were true. Considering what his past was
supposed to have been, the grave man who watched her
with troubled eyes was hard to understand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyril,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;has Harry given you our address
at Glacier and Banff?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He supposed that this implied permission to write to
her, but he could not do so as Jack Prescott and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
already bitterly regretted that he had allowed her to
think of him as Jernyngham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, with a carelessness which cost him an
effort. &#8220;But I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m not a good correspondent.
I&#8217;m too busy, for one thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too busy?&#8221; she mocked, with a stronger color in her
face. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you spare half an hour from your plowing
to write to your friends?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he answered with forced coolness, &#8220;it&#8217;s
difficult, except, of course, in the winter and you&#8217;ll be
back in England then, with so many festivities on hand
that you won&#8217;t be anxious to hear about Canada.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked at him for a moment, puzzled and a little
angry, and he guessed her thoughts. He was behaving
like a boor; but it was better that she should think him
one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How very un-English you have become!&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean I&#8217;m very Canadian? Anyway, I try to be
sensible&mdash;I&#8217;ve done some wretchedly foolish things and
I&#8217;ve got to pay for them. Of course, this visit&#8217;s only an
episode to you; something that&#8217;s soon over and forgotten.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was trouble in his voice, though he strove to
speak with indifference, and after a swift glance at him
she answered coldly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it is. One impression rubs out another, and
no doubt we shall see something novel and interesting
farther on. However, we won&#8217;t stay in Canada very long
and we shall see your father and sister as soon as we get
home. It&#8217;s curious that you have scarcely mentioned
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; he evaded awkwardly, &#8220;Harry has told
me a good deal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned his head, dreading her curious eyes. His
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
last evening in her company was proving more trying than
he had expected; though usually tolerant and good-humored,
the strain made him bitter. To-morrow he
must put this girl out of his mind. After all, it was to
Cyril Jernyngham, rake and wastrel, but a man of her
own station, that she had been gracious and charming;
had she known he was Jack Prescott, she would, no
doubt, have treated him very differently; but in this supposition
he did her wrong.
</p>
<p>Puzzled by his lack of responsiveness and with wounded
pride, she stopped and looked out toward the northwest
across the prairie. Steeped in strong coloring, it seemed
to run back into immeasurable distance, though a wonderful
blaze of crimson marked its rim. The faint, cool
air that flowed across it was charged with a curious exhilarating
quality; there was a subtle fragrance of herbs
in the grass.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting late,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I must go in. This is
the last sunset I shall watch on the prairie, and in several
ways I&#8217;m sorry. You have made our stay here very
pleasant.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE MYSTERY OF THE MUSKEG</h3>
</div>

<p>Colston and his party had been gone a fortnight
when Prescott called at the Jernyngham homestead
one afternoon and found its owner sitting moodily in the
kitchen, which presented a chaotic appearance. Unwashed
plates and dishes were scattered about, the wood-box
was overturned and poplar billets strewed the floor,
there was no fire in the rusty stove, and the fragments
of a heavy crock lay against the wall. The strong sunlight
that streamed in emphasized the disorder of the
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was passing and thought I&#8217;d come in,&#8221; Prescott
explained. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Mrs. Jernyngham? The look
of the place gives one the idea that she&#8217;s not at home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s never remarkably tidy.&#8221; Jernyngham broke
into a rueful smile. &#8220;I believe she started for the settlement
when I was at work in the summer fallow this
morning. The fact that the horse and buggy are missing
points to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you know whether she has gone or not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Jernyngham. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t acquaint
me with her intentions. As I see she has taken some
things along, it looks as if she meant to visit Mrs. Harvey
at the store. They&#8217;re friends now and then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His manner was suggestive, though he looked more
resigned than disturbed, and Prescott, glancing at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
shattered crock, ventured a question which he feared
was not quite judicious:
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you break that thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It ought to be a warning. I didn&#8217;t break it; it was
meant to break on me. Ellice flung it at my head a day
or two ago, and fortunately missed, though as a rule
she&#8217;s a pretty good shot. I suppose it&#8217;s significant that
neither of us troubled to pick up the pieces.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott looked sympathetic, and hesitated, with his
half-filled pipe in his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I go, Cyril? I want to make Sebastian before
it&#8217;s dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit still,&#8221; Jernyngham told him. &#8220;I&#8217;m in an expansive
mood, and I&#8217;ve a notion that I&#8217;m not far off a crisis
in my affairs. Ellice has been fractious lately; I seem to
have been getting on her nerves, which perhaps is not
surprising.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott made no comment and after sitting silent a
few moments Jernyngham resumed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was rather rash when I ventured to remonstrate
about a bill. Ellice pointed out, with justice, that so long
as I slouched round and let Wandle rob me, I&#8217;d no right to
grumble at her for buying a few things. Most unwisely
I maintained my point and&#8221;&mdash;he indicated the broken
crock and littered table&mdash;&#8220;you see the consequences.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wandle is a bit of a rogue,&#8221; said Prescott, choosing
the safest topic. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told you so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have. For all that, he&#8217;s useful and I don&#8217;t
mind being robbed in moderation; I&#8217;m a man who&#8217;s
accustomed to losing things.&#8221; His half-mocking tone
grew serious. &#8220;I wrote to my people, as soon as Colston
left, telling them I&#8217;d determined to remain in Canada;
but if it wasn&#8217;t for Ellice, I think I&#8217;d quit farming.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>Prescott smoked in silence for a while. Jernyngham
had made a costly sacrifice, chiefly on the woman&#8217;s
account, and Prescott felt sorry for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;d better get on,&#8221; he said after a while.
</p>
<p>For a few moments Jernyngham looked irresolute, and
then he got up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come with you to Sebastian. I think I&#8217;d have
gone earlier, only Ellice had the horse and rig, and
Wandle&#8217;s using the wagon team. It&#8217;s no doubt my duty
to sue for peace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They set out shortly afterward and reaching Sebastian
late in the evening drove to the livery-stable, where
Jernyngham called the man who took Prescott&#8217;s team.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you have my horse?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said the fellow, looking at him curiously.
&#8220;Mrs. Jernyngham said we&#8217;d better keep him until
you came in. She left a note for you with the boss;
he&#8217;s in the hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham crossed the street, followed by his companion,
and Prescott noticed that the loungers in the bar
seemed interested when they came in. Two of them put
down their glasses and turned to fix their eyes on Jernyngham,
a third paused in the act of lighting his pipe and
dropped the match. Then the owner of the livery-stable
looked up in a hesitating manner as Jernyngham approached
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you have a message for me,&#8221; Jernyngham
said abruptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; the man rejoined gravely. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give it to
you outside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They left the bar, and when they stood under the
veranda, Jernyngham tore open the envelope handed him.
A moment later he firmly crumpled up the note it had held.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When did she leave?&#8221; he asked in a harsh voice.
</p>
<p>The liveryman regarded him sympathetically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the afternoon East-bound. I&#8217;m mighty sorry,
Cyril&mdash;guess you know it isn&#8217;t a secret in the town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham&#8217;s face grew darkly flushed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can tell me whom she went with?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The drummer who was selling the separators.
Bought tickets through to St. Paul. Told Perkins he
wasn&#8217;t coming back here; nothing doing on this round.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man tactfully moved away and Jernyngham
turned to Prescott, speaking rather hoarsely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone&mdash;that&#8217;s the end of it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He dropped into one of the chairs scattered about and
a few moments later broke into a bitter laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have been more flattering if she had chosen
you or Wandle instead of that blasted weedy drummer.
Still, there the thing is, and it has to be faced.&#8221; Then he
surprised his companion, for his voice and expression
became suddenly normal. &#8220;Go in and get me a cigar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He lighted it carefully when it was brought to him and
leaned back in his chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to hold myself in hand&mdash;if
I start off on the jag now, it will be a dangerous one.
Have you noticed that I&#8217;ve been practising strict abstinence
since Colston left?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott, not knowing how to regard his ironic calmness,
said nothing, and Jernyngham continued:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bitter pill. I was very fond of her once, and
there&#8217;s not much consolation in reflecting that she&#8217;ll
probably scare the fellow out of his wits the first time she
breaks out in one of her rages.&#8221; Then his voice grew
regretful. &#8220;Ellice&#8217;s far from perfect, but she&#8217;s much too
good for him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>Remembering that it was on the woman&#8217;s account his
friend had remained on the prairie, Prescott made a
venture:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since she has gone, it&#8217;s a pity she didn&#8217;t go a few
weeks earlier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t count,&#8221; declared Jernyngham. &#8220;She
has cause to blame me as much for marrying her&mdash;one
must try to be just. I thought of her when I determined
to stay, but my own weaknesses played as big a part in
deciding me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat silent a while, and then indicated his surroundings
with a contemptuous sweep of his hand&mdash;the dirty
sidewalk strewn with cigar ends and banana peelings,
the straggling houses with their cracked board walls and
ugly square fronts, the rutted street down which drifted
clouds of dust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m very sick of all this, and I can&#8217;t
face the lonely homestead now Ellice&#8217;s gone. I must
have a change and something to brace me; something
that has a keener bite than drink. Think I&#8217;ll take a
haulage job on the new railroad, where there ought to be
rough and risky work, and I&#8217;ll leave this place to-night.
Come across with me to Morant&#8217;s, and I&#8217;ll see what I can
borrow on the land.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sudden unreasoning decision was characteristic of
him, but Prescott expostulated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t clear out in this eccentric fashion; there are
a number of things to be settled first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I can,&#8221; Jernyngham retorted dryly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
certain that I can&#8217;t stay here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took his companion with him to call on a land-agent
and mortgage-broker, and when they left the office
Jernyngham had a bulky roll of bills in his pocket.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; he requested, &#8220;you&#8217;ll run my place and pay
Morant off after harvest; if Wandle gets his hands on it,
there&#8217;ll be very little left when I come back. You may
have trouble with him, but you must hold out. Charge
me with all expenses and pay as much of the surplus as
you think I&#8217;m entitled to into my bank when you have
sold the crop. Now if you&#8217;ll come into the hotel, I&#8217;ll give
you a written authority and get Perkins to witness it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott demurred at first, but eventually yielded
because he believed his friend&#8217;s interest would need
looking after in his absence. After some discussion they
agreed on a workable scheme, which was put down in
writing and witnessed by the hotel-keeper. Then
Jernyngham borrowed a saddle and sent for his horse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pull out for the railroad now; it&#8217;s cooler riding at
night and there&#8217;s a good moon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As I&#8217;ll pass
close to your place, you may as well drive so far
with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They set off, Prescott seated on the front of his jolting
wagon, Jernyngham riding as near it as the roughness of
the trail permitted, with a blanket and a package of
provisions strapped to his saddle. He was wearing a hat
of extra-thick felt and uncommon shape which had been
given him by a man who had broken his journey for the
purpose of seeing the country when returning from Hong
Kong by the Canadian Pacific route. Soon after they
left Sebastian, a young trooper of the Northwest Police
dressed in khaki uniform came trotting up in the moonlight
and joined them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you off to, Jernyngham?&#8221; he asked,
glancing at the rolled up blanket. &#8220;Looks as if you
meant to camp on the trail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to, most likely,&#8221; said Jernyngham. &#8220;I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
leaving the farm to Prescott for a while and heading for
Nelson&#8217;s Butte on the new road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought I&#8217;d pick up a horse or two at one of the
ranches I&#8217;ll pass and apply for a teaming job. Contractor
was asking for haulage tenders; he&#8217;s having trouble
among the sandhills and muskegs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll be taking a wad of money along?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham assented and the trooper looked thoughtful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he cautioned, &#8220;there&#8217;s a pretty tough crowd
at Nelson, and though we stopped any licenses being
issued, we&#8217;ve had trouble over the running-in of liquor.
Then you have a long ride before you through a thinly-settled
country. You want to be careful about that
money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The settlers are to be trusted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, but we have reason to believe the rustlers
are at work in the district; seem to have been going into
the liquor business, and I&#8217;ve heard of horses missing.
Now that the boys have stopped their branding other
people&#8217;s calves in Alberta and corralled their leaders, it
looks as if the fellows were beginning the game in this
part of the country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Jernyngham. &#8220;I may as well take
precautions. How would you recommend my carrying
the money?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The trooper made one or two ingenious suggestions as
to the safest way of secreting the bills, and Jernyngham,
dismounting, carried them out. Soon afterward the
trooper struck off across the plain, and the others, riding
on, met a farmer who spoke to them as he passed. At
length Prescott pulled up his team at the spot where his
companion must leave the trail.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do what I can with the land, Cyril, and keep an
account,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You might write and let me know
how you are getting on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They shook hands and Jernyngham trotted away,
while Prescott sat watching him for a minute or two.
Man and horse were sharply outlined against the moonlit
grass. Jernyngham looked very lonely as he rode out
into the wilderness. He could hardly have been happy,
Prescott thought, in his untidy and comfortless house at
the farm; but, after all, it had been a home, and now he
was rudely flung adrift. It was true that the man was
largely responsible for the troubles that had fallen upon
him, but this was no reason for refusing him pity, and
Cyril had his strong points. He had staunchly declined
to profit by a felicitous change of fortune out of consideration
for the relatives who had once disowned and
the woman who had deserted him. Jernyngham had been
a careless fool, and Prescott suspected that he was not
likely to alter much in this respect, but he did not expect
others to pay for his recklessness when the reckoning
came. Then Prescott started his team.
</p>
<p>Two days later, he was busy in front of his homestead
putting together a new binder which had just arrived
from the settlement. It was the latest type of harvesting
implement and designed to cut an unusually broad
swath. While he was engaged, the trooper he had met
when accompanying Jernyngham rode up with a corporal
following. He stopped his horse and glanced at the
binder with admiration.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a daisy, Jack; I guess she cost a pile,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Where did you get the money to buy a machine of that
kind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t easy to raise it,&#8221; Prescott replied. &#8220;But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
I&#8217;ll save something in labor&mdash;harvest wages are high&mdash;and
I&#8217;ve long wanted this binder. When Trant came
round from the implement store yesterday morning I
thought I&#8217;d risk the deal. Will you wait for dinner?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks,&#8221; the corporal broke in. &#8220;We&#8217;re making
a patrol north; just called to look at your guards. Several
big grass fires have been reported in the last few
days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott pointed to the rows of plowed furrows which
cut off his holding from the prairie. The strip of brown
clods, which was two or three yards in width, seemed an
adequate defense, and after a glance at it the corporal
nodded his satisfaction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take the trail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He trotted away with his companion and it was evening
when they rode along the edge of a ravine which pierced
a high tract of rolling country. The crest of the slope
they followed commanded a vast circle of grass that was
changing in the foreground from green to ocher and
silvery white. Farther back, it ran on toward the sunset,
a sweep of blue and neutral gray, flecked with dusky
lines of bluffs, interspersed with gleaming strips of water,
but nowhere in the wide landscape was there a sign of
human habitation. Small birches and poplars, with an
undergrowth of nut bushes, clothed the sides of the
ravine, but some distance ahead it broadened out and the
stream that flowed through it turned the hollow into a
muskeg. There harsh grass and reeds grew three or
four feet high, hiding the stretch of mire.
</p>
<p>The police were young men with deeply bronzed faces,
dressed in smart khaki uniform with broad Stetson hats
of the same color.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; exclaimed Corporal Curtis, pointing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
to an indistinct object lying among a patch of scrub some
distance off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like a hat,&#8221; replied Private Stanton. &#8220;Some
settler prospecting for a homestead location must have
lost it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You jump at things!&#8221; said the corporal. &#8220;How&#8217;d
the man lose it? Guess it wouldn&#8217;t drop off without his
knowing it, and with the sun we&#8217;ve been having he&#8217;d
want it pretty bad. He wouldn&#8217;t throw it away, when
he knew he couldn&#8217;t get another. We&#8217;ll go along and
see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They dismounted a minute or two later and made a
startling discovery. The hat was a good one, but in one
place the soft gray felt had been crushed and partly cut
as though by a heavy blow. On turning it over, they
saw that the inside was stained a dull red.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Blood!&#8221; said Curtis significantly, and swept a searching
glance about. &#8220;More of it,&#8221; he added. &#8220;See here&mdash;on
the brush.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Moving forward, they found a succession of crimson
spots and splashes on the leaves of the willow scrub and
withering grass.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Picket the horses. Stanton; we&#8217;ve got to look into
this,&#8221; the corporal said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d better lead them back a piece,&#8221; responded his
companion. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to muss up things by
making fresh tracks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he had done so, they set about the examination
systematically. They were men who lived, for the most
part, in the open, and made long journeys through the
wilds, sleeping where they could find shelter in ravine
or bluff. Such things as a broken twig, a bruised tuft
of grass, or a mark in loose soil had a meaning to them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
and here they had plentiful material to work upon.
Counting footprints and hoofmarks, measuring distances,
they constructed bit by bit the drama that had taken
place, but half an hour had passed before they sat down
to talk it over and took out their pipes. The afterglow
shone about them; their hands and thoughtful faces
showed the same warm color as the brown grass in the
ruddy light. In the hat lay a five-dollar bill and a coat
button.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There were two men here,&#8221; Curtis remarked.
&#8220;Both were mounted and came up the trail from the
settlement, but it looks as if the first one had picketed
his horse and started to make camp when the other
joined him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; Private Stanton agreed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there was trouble, but the men didn&#8217;t clinch.
One fellow hit the other with something heavy enough
to drop him in his tracks, then got into the saddle and
rode off, leading the other horse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The evidence on which he arrived at this conclusion
was slender, but Stanton signified assent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;where&#8217;s the hurt man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a notion he&#8217;s in yonder muskeg. The other
fellow could have packed him there on the led horse&mdash;the
blood spots point to it&mdash;though he might have hid him
farther on in a bluff. It&#8217;s getting too dark to search now;
we&#8217;ll try to-morrow. But I guess we know who he is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Stanton. &#8220;I&#8217;ll swear to the hat. Chaffed
Jernyngham about it one day, and he put it in my hands
and said there wasn&#8217;t another of the kind in the country.
A man from Hong Kong gave it to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis took up the bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Five dollars, Merchants&#8217; Bank, and quite clean; not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
been issued long. We&#8217;ll find out if they&#8217;ve a branch at
Regina or Saskatoon and trace up the fellow they paid
it to. The button doesn&#8217;t count&mdash;quite a common pattern.
Now if you&#8217;ll fill the kettle at the creek, I&#8217;ll start
a fire. We&#8217;ll camp near the birch scrub yonder.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A DEAL IN LAND</h3>
</div>

<p>On the morning after the corporal&#8217;s discovery,
Gustave Wandle was leading his team to a drinking
pool on the creek that crossed his farm. He was a big,
reserved, fair-haired man, with a fleshy face that was
redeemed from heaviness by his eyes, which were restless
and keen. Though supposed to be an Austrian, little
was known about him or his antecedents except that he
owned the next half-section of land to Jernyngham&#8217;s and
farmed it successfully. It was, however, believed that
he was of an unusually grasping nature, and his neighbors
took precautions when they made a deal with him. He
had reached the shadow of a poplar bluff when he heard
hurried footsteps and a man with a hot face came into
sight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going across your place to save time; I want my
horse,&#8221; he explained hastily. &#8220;Curtis, the policeman,
has ridden in to the settlement and told me to go up
and search a muskeg near the north trail with Stanton.
Somebody&#8217;s killed Jernyngham and hidden him there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; exclaimed Wandle. &#8220;Jernyngham murdered!
You tell me that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing!&#8221; the other replied. &#8220;The police have
figured out how it all happened and I&#8217;m going to look
for the body while Curtis reports to his bosses. A
blamed pity! I liked Jernyngham. Well, I must get
to the muskeg soon as I can!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>He ran on, and Wandle led his horses to the pool and
stood thinking hard while they drank. He was well
versed in Jernyngham&#8217;s affairs and knew that he had once
bought a cheap quarter-section of land in an arid belt
some distance off. A railroad had since entered the
district, irrigation work had been begun, and the holding
must have risen in value. Now, it seemed, Jernyngham
was dead, which was unfortunate, because Wandle had
found their joint operations profitable, and it was very
probable that Ellice and himself were the only persons
who knew about the land. Wandle mounted one of the
horses and set out for Jernyngham&#8217;s homestead at its
fastest pace.
</p>
<p>On reaching it, he soon found an iron cash-box in a
cupboard and succeeded in forcing it with a screw-driver.
It contained a few papers, among which were one or two
relating to the purchase of the quarter-section, and
Wandle put these in his pocket. The others he threw
into the cupboard&mdash;Jernyngham&#8217;s carelessness was well
known&mdash;and then hastily studied a railroad time-table.
By starting promptly, he could catch a train at the station
next after Sebastian, which he thought would be wiser,
and reach a new wooden town of some importance in
the evening. Having ascertained this, he hurried out and
rode home, taking the cash-box with him. On arriving,
he smashed it flat with an ax and flung it into his stove in
which a fire was burning; then he made a hasty meal,
changed his clothes, and saddling a horse, rode hard
across the prairie. There was, he realized, some risk in
what he meant to do, but it was not a very serious one,
and he was thankful that the sale of land is attended by
few formalities in western Canada.
</p>
<p>When he reached his destination, business premises
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
were closed for the night, but after making inquiries he
found a land agent who was recommended as respectable
and trustworthy at a smart hotel. Wandle led him to
the far end of the lobby, where they would not be
disturbed, and sitting down at a table took out the
papers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that quarter-section worth?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>The agent told him and Wandle lighted his pipe and
affected to consider. He thought Jernyngham had not
suspected its value.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you could get another three dollars
an acre?&#8221; he suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible, if you will leave the sale in my hands; but
I may have to wait for a suitable opportunity. There&#8217;s
a good demand for land in the district now that they&#8217;re
getting on with the irrigation scheme, but to insist on
the top price will mean delay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you sell it for me promptly at the figure you
mentioned?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; said the agent. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a number of inquiries
for farming land on my books. I shouldn&#8217;t
wonder if I fixed the thing up in a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait a week. There&#8217;s a pretty good haulage
contract I could get, but it will take some financing,
which is what brought me along; because I ought to see
about it in the next few days. Now I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll
do&mdash;I&#8217;ll sell you that land to-night at the lower figure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The agent pondered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; he said, irresolutely. &#8220;I&#8217;d only make a few
dollars an acre on the deal, and I can get ten per cent. on
my money right in this hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have to wait a year for it, wouldn&#8217;t you? What
price will give you ten per cent. profit on this quarter-section?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
You want to remember that you may get it in
a few weeks, and you&#8217;d have first-class security.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After making a rough calculation in his notebook, the
agent looked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As a rule, I prefer to buy for other people, but I
can&#8217;t go back on what I said about land being in strong
demand, and I&#8217;ll make you a bid. This is the most
I can do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wandle, after trying to raise the price, made a sign of
acquiescence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let it go at that. I&#8217;ll get things fixed up as soon
as the land-office is open in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He left the hotel, satisfied on the whole, though he had
sacrificed a dollar or two an acre and there was an element
of danger in what he had done. The sale of the
land must be registered, and the date would be two or
three days after the one on which Jernyngham was killed.
The latter&#8217;s homestead was, however, a long distance off,
there was only one small weekly newspaper published in
the district, and it was very probable that the agent
would not hear of the affair until some time had elapsed,
and then might not attach any importance to the fact that
the victim&#8217;s name was that of his customer. Even if he
did so, the small discrepancy in the dates would, no
doubt, escape his attention. Wandle did not think he
had much cause for uneasiness.
</p>
<p>Reaching home the next day, he raked out his stove and
found the cash-box. It had not fallen to pieces as he had
expected, and he doubled it up again with the ax before
he flung it into the ash pail. Then he lighted the stove
and set about getting supper, for it was late in the evening.
After finishing the meal, he threw some fragments
of potatoes and a rind of pork into the pail and took it up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
to carry it to the refuse heap, but stopped with a start when
he left the house. It was getting dark, but two shadowy
figures were riding up the trail and by the way they sat
their horses he recognized them as police troopers. Putting
down the pail, he waited until they dismounted near-by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too late for supper, Curtis,&#8221; he said coolly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve just cleaned it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The corporal glanced at the pail and in the dim light
noticed only the domestic refuse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had some,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I want a few minutes&#8217;
talk.&#8221; Then he motioned to his companion.
&#8220;Hitch the horses, Stanton, and come in when you&#8217;re
ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They entered the house, followed presently by the
trooper, and Wandle lighted his pipe. He felt more at
ease with it in his hand and he suspected that he would
need all his collectedness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you know that Jernyngham&#8217;s missing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard that he was killed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like it,&#8221; said Curtis. &#8220;You know the muskeg
where the creek spreads out, about fourteen miles north?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t; never been up so far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis noticed the prompt disclaimer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, Jernyngham rode there and was knocked
out with something heavy that must have left him
stunned, if it didn&#8217;t make an end of him. He didn&#8217;t
ride away after it, though his horse went on. The point
is that it was led.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; Wandle asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my business to know these things. Think we
can&#8217;t tell the difference between the tracks of a led horse
and a ridden one? The only times two horses trot close
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
together at an even distance is when one&#8217;s rider has both
bridles, or when they&#8217;re yoked to a wagon pole. However,
I&#8217;ve come to ask if you can throw any light on the
matter? You and Jernyngham were partners, in a way,
weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. Now and then we bought implements and
horses, or hired a tractor plow, between us. As a matter
of fact, Jernyngham owed me about five hundred dollars.
Anyhow, I&#8217;m as puzzled about the thing as you must be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you think we&#8217;re puzzled?&#8221; Curtis said in a
significant tone.
</p>
<p>Wandle laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It struck me as likely. You know there&#8217;s not a
rancher in the district who would hurt the man. He
was easy to get on with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know that he borrowed money on his holding
and took it with him the night he disappeared?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Wandle, starting. &#8220;I&#8217;m not pleased
to hear it now. I&#8217;ve a claim on the place and there are
some pretty big storekeepers&#8217; bills to come in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis asked a few more questions before he took his
leave. He passed near the ash pail as he went out and
Stanton touched it with his foot, but they had mounted
and reached the trail before either of them spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Curtis.
</p>
<p>Stanton smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing much to be learned from him; the fellow&#8217;s
about as sly and hard to get at as a coyote.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A sure thing,&#8221; Curtis agreed. &#8220;We&#8217;ll keep an eye on
him; I&#8217;ve a suspicion he knows something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then they trotted away in the moonlight, for it was a
long ride to their camp beside the muskeg, which with the
assistance of several men they were engaged in searching.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>On the next afternoon, Prescott was at work in the
summer fallow, sitting in the iron saddle of a gangplow,
which four powerful horses hauled through the crackling
stubble. It was fiercely hot and he was lightly clad in
thin yellow shirt and overalls. A cloud of dust rose about
him from the parched soil, and the broad expanse of
wheat which the fallow divided glowed with varied
colors as it rippled before the rush of breeze, the strong
greens changing to a silvery luster as the lush blades bent
and caught the light. Farther on, there were faint streaks
of yellow among the oats; the great stretch of grass was
white and delicate gray, the rows of clods behind the
plow rich chocolate-brown.
</p>
<p>Prescott, however, paid little attention to his surroundings.
He was perhaps the only man in the district
who had known Jernyngham intimately; he felt troubled
about his disappearance, and he had had a disturbing
interview with Wandle during the morning. The
Austrian had contested his right to manage the farm,
declaring that Jernyngham owed him money and had
made certain plans for the joint working of their land
which must be carried out. This did not so much
matter, in a sense, if one could take Jernyngham&#8217;s death
for granted; but Prescott could not do so and had, moreover,
no intention of letting his property fall into the hands
of a cunning, grasping fellow, who, he was fully persuaded,
had no real right to it. If Jernyngham did not
turn up, Prescott meant to discharge all his debts after
harvest and, as the crop promised well, to send the balance
to England as a proof that his friend had not been a
failure in Canada. This might be some comfort to
Jernyngham&#8217;s people.
</p>
<p>He was considering the matter when he heard the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
stubble crackle behind him and, looking around, saw
Curtis riding up. Stopping his team, he waited until the
corporal drew bridle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you found him yet?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have not,&#8221; said Curtis. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big muskeg and
quite deep. You know the place?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I know it pretty well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis looked at him sharply, but Prescott seemed to
be musing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sad thing when you think of it,&#8221; he said after a
few moments. &#8220;From the little he told me, the man had
hard luck all through; and that Mrs. Jernyngham should
leave him just after he&#8217;d sacrificed his future for her must
have been a knock-out blow. Yet I&#8217;ve an idea that instead
of crushing it braced him. It pulled him up; he
showed signs of turning into a different man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew him better than I did,&#8221; Curtis replied.
&#8220;I heard at the hotel he&#8217;d asked you to look after his
place, given you a share in the crop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He did. I&#8217;d some words with Wandle about the
matter this morning; Jernyngham warned me he might
pretend he had a claim. However, that&#8217;s not to the purpose;
somehow I feel convinced he&#8217;ll turn up again.
What motive could any one have for killing him? The
only man we might have suspected&mdash;the fellow who
went off with Ellice&mdash;must have been on the train bound
for St. Paul.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was; we wired the conductor. But the thing&#8217;s
quite simple&mdash;the motive was robbery. You remember
that wad of bills?&#8221; The corporal paused before he
added: &#8220;Where did you last see Jernyngham?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At the trail-forks near my place. He rode right on;
I took the turning.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see your man, Svendsen, or his wife when
you got home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t; they live at the back of the house. I put
up the horses, slipped in quietly, and went to bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can&#8217;t fix the time you got back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott moved sharply, lifting his head, while an
angry color suffused his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Curtis, you can&#8217;t think&mdash;Jernyngham was my best
friend!&#8221; Then he laughed indignantly. &#8220;You always
struck me as a sensible man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The corporal regarded him with scrutinizing eyes, his
manner stamped with official austerity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m forming no opinions&mdash;yet. It&#8217;s my duty to find
out all I can about the matter and report. If there&#8217;s
anything you&#8217;re open to tell me, I&#8217;ll make a note of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott&#8217;s face grew stern and his glance very steady.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can add nothing to what I&#8217;ve said, and I&#8217;m busy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis rode away, but when he was out of the rancher&#8217;s
sight he broke into a dry smile. He was an astute young
man and knew his business, which was merely to investigate
and follow the instruction of his chiefs at Regina.
Unembroidered facts were what they required in the first
instance, but later he might be permitted to theorize.
</p>
<p>When the corporal had gone, Prescott went on with
his plowing, but the crackle of the stubble and the thud
of the heavy Clydesdales&#8217; hoofs fell unheeded on his ears,
and it was half-consciously that he turned his team at the
head-land. He had a good deal to think about and his
thoughts were far from pleasant. To begin with, the
memory of Muriel Hurst had haunted him since she left;
he recalled her with a regretful longing that seemed to
grow steadily stronger instead of diminishing. He
thought she had left an indelible mark on his life. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
there was his impersonation of Jernyngham, which he
had rashly agreed to, but did not now regret. If Colston
had met Cyril on the night of the riot and had gone to
his untidy dwelling, he would have been forced to send
home an adverse report. Prescott was glad to think he
had saved his friend from a farther fall in his English
relatives&#8217; esteem, though, knowing a little of the man&#8217;s
story, he held them largely responsible for his reckless
career. Their censoriousness and suspicion had, no
doubt, driven him into wilder rashness.
</p>
<p>Besides all this, the corporal&#8217;s manner rankled in his
mind. He knew Curtis well and had a good opinion of
his ability. It seemed preposterous that such a man
could imagine that he had had any hand in Jernyngham&#8217;s
death. Yet the corporal&#8217;s tone had been significant and
the facts had an ugly look. He had seen Jernyngham
secrete his money and had afterward ridden on with him,
unaccompanied by anybody else. He could not prove
when he returned to his farm, and it might be said that
he stood to benefit by securing the management of Jernyngham&#8217;s
property.
</p>
<p>When he reached the end of the furrows his face was
grim, but he steadily continued his plowing.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE SEARCH</h3>
</div>

<p>Prescott dismounted and turned loose his horse,
short-hobbled, near the muskeg about two o&#8217;clock
one hot afternoon. He had begun work at four that
morning, and, with harvest drawing near, time was precious
to him, but he was filled with a keen curiosity to
see what progress Curtis had made in his search. He
had a strong personal interest in the matter, because it
seemed that some suspicion might rest on him; though he
was far from sharing the corporal&#8217;s conviction that Jernyngham
was dead. Stopping at the edge of the ravine,
he looked about, taking in the details of the scene.
</p>
<p>Though the prairie had lost its greenness and the flowers
had died, it stretched away, flooded with dazzling light, a
great expanse of silvery gray, flecked with faint lemon and
brown. In the swampy hollow, however, the grass grew
tall and green among the shining pools, and Prescott noticed
to his astonishment a dozen men working assiduously
lower down. They had discarded most of their clothing,
their brown arms were bare, and the stiff, dark-colored
soil they flung up with their shovels cumbered the bank of
the ravine, which had narrowed in again. Prescott saw
that they were cutting a deeper channel for the creek, with
the object of draining the swamp.
</p>
<p>Moving farther along the bank, he came upon the two
policemen, who looked very hot and somewhat muddy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
which, as they were usually fastidiously neat, was noticeable.
He felt some hesitation in accosting them, as he
recalled the corporal&#8217;s attitude when they last met, but
he was curious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you have found nothing?&#8221; he said, and
when Curtis made a sign of negation continued: &#8220;How
did you get so many of the boys here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Putting his hand in his pocket, the policeman gave him
a printed circular which announced that a reward of one
thousand dollars would be paid for the discovery of Cyril
Jernyngham&#8217;s remains.
</p>
<p>&#8220;His people in the old country cabled it over,&#8221; he
explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Prescott said thoughtfully, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
he&#8217;s here; but he was a friend of mine, and I&#8217;m as anxious
to have the question answered as you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Private Stanton, who was sitting in the grass, looked up
with a rather significant smile. Indeed, there was a certain
reserve in the manner of both men which exasperated
the rancher.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite likely you&#8217;ll have to wait,&#8221; Curtis rejoined.
&#8220;Even when we&#8217;ve run the water out, it may take a long
while to search the mushy stuff it will leave, and if we&#8217;re
beaten here, we&#8217;ll have to try the bluffs.&#8221; He looked hard
at Prescott. &#8220;We don&#8217;t let up until we find him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me where I can get a shovel and I&#8217;ll help the
boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stanton brought him one and for the next two hours he
worked savagely, standing knee-deep in water in a trench,
hacking out clods of the &#8220;gumbo&#8221; soil, which covers much
of the prairie and grows the finest wheat. When dry it
sets like stone, when wet it assumes a glutinous stickiness
which makes it exceptionally difficult to deal with. Fierce
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
sunshine poured down on Prescott&#8217;s bent head and
shoulders, his hands grew sore, and mire and water
splashed upon him, but he was hard and leanly muscular
and, driven as he was by a keen desire to test the
corporal&#8217;s theory, he would have toiled on until the next
morning, had it been needful. At length, however, there
was a warning cry from one of the men nearer the swamp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch out! Let her go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott leaped from the trench. There was a roar
higher up the ravine, and a turgid flood, streaked with
frothy lines, came pouring down the new channel, bearing
with it small nut bushes and great clumps of matted grass.
By degrees it subsided, and the men, gathering about the
edge of the muskeg, hot and splashed with mire, lay down
to smoke and wait, while the pools that still remained grew
smaller. They had been working hard since early morning
and they did not talk much, but Prescott, sitting a
little away from them, was conscious of an unpleasant
tension. It was possible that the search might prove Curtis
right. The corporal stood higher up the bank, scanning
each clump of grass and reeds with keenly scrutinizing
eyes. At length, however, he approached the others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ve made a job, boys,&#8221; he told them.
&#8220;The soft spots ought to dry out in about a week, but
we can&#8217;t wait till then. You want to remember there&#8217;s
a thousand dollars for the man who finds him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They glanced at the morass hesitatingly. It did not
look inviting. In places the reeds grew as high as their
heads, and one could not tell what depths they hid. In
other spots there were tracks of slimy ooze in which one
might sink a long way. None of them, however, was
fastidious, and they waded out into the mire, shouting
warnings to one another, disappearing now and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
among the grass. The search was partially rewarded,
for while Prescott and a companion were skirting a
clump of reeds they saw part of a soaked garment protruding
from the slime. For a few moments they stood
looking at it irresolutely; and then Prescott, mustering
his courage, advanced and seized the stained material.
It came away more readily than he had expected, and he
turned to his companion, conscious of keen relief, with
a brown overall jacket in his hand. A further examination,
shrinkingly made, revealed nothing else, and after
marking the place they waded to the bank. The garment
was carefully washed in the creek and the men gathered
in a ring round Curtis when he inspected it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have any of you seen this thing before?&#8221; he asked,
holding it up.
</p>
<p>None of them would identify it. Thin duck overalls
are commonly worn by ranchers and working people,
in place of heavier clothing, during the hot weather.
Then Curtis turned to Prescott.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your idea?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t Jernyngham&#8217;s,&#8221; the rancher said decidedly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s too old, for one thing; looks as if it had been in the
water quite a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard to tell,&#8221; commented Curtis. &#8220;But go on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott took the jacket and held it so that the others
could see the inside of the collar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No maker&#8217;s tag,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Now Cyril always
bought the kind they give you a doll with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One of the others laughed and supplied the name of the
manufacturer, which was attached to every garment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen three or four of those dolls and golliwog
things in his house,&#8221; the man added. &#8220;Used to guy him
about keeping them, as he had no kids.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We can fix the thing by inquiring at the dry goods
store,&#8221; Curtis rejoined.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t see whose it was, if it wasn&#8217;t Jernyngham&#8217;s,&#8221;
another broke in. &#8220;There&#8217;s no homestead anywhere near
the creek and mighty few people come up here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The policeman took from his pocket a wet envelope,
upon which the blurred writing was still legible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said coolly, &#8220;there&#8217;s no doubt about whose
this is.&#8221; He handed it to Prescott. &#8220;Ever see it in
Jernyngham&#8217;s possession?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Prescott with some hesitation. &#8220;I
recognize the address, though the English stamp has
gone. It was lying near when he was talking to me on
the night of the trouble in Sebastian.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was filled with uneasiness. The police would
certainly attempt to read the letter, which was the one
Colston had written announcing his arrival. If they
succeeded, they would no doubt wonder why the Englishman
had not stayed with Jernyngham, and investigation
might lead to a discovery of the part Prescott had played.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve begun quite satisfactorily,&#8221; said the corporal,
&#8220;and there&#8217;s nothing more to be done to-night. I guess
you can quit and have supper, boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a little while trails of gray smoke floated across the
ravine, and after a meal with one of his neighbors Prescott
rode back to his homestead, feeling much disturbed.
For all that, and in spite of the letter, he did not think
Jernyngham would be found in the swamp.
</p>
<p>On the following evening a commissioned officer of the
police, who had made the journey from headquarters at
Regina and spent an hour or two examining the scene of
the supposititious tragedy, sat with Curtis in a very hot
private room of the hotel at Sebastian. Its raw board
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
walls gave out a resinous smell; the opening in the window
was filled with mosquito-netting, so that little air
crept in. On the table lay a carefully made diagram; a
boot, and one or two paper patterns representing footprints
were on the floor. The officer&#8217;s hair was turning
gray and he had a quiet brown face with a look of command
in it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking it for granted that your theory&#8217;s right, suspicion
seems to fall on the men you mentioned,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Whom do you suspect?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis considered. He was reluctant to express a decided
opinion in the presence of his superior, who was
famous for his acumen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as we have any evidence, I think it points to
Prescott,&#8221; he responded. &#8220;He saw Jernyngham hide
his money; he went on alone with him, and can&#8217;t prove
when he got home. Then several of the footprints
marked on the plan might have been made by him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The officer took up the boot and one of the paper
patterns.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a doubt. I suppose he knows you have his
boot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The corporal&#8217;s eyes twinkled faintly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;ll miss it sometime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible. But what else have you against him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Prescott stands to profit by Jernyngham&#8217;s death: he
has control of the holding until the year&#8217;s up, and it&#8217;s a
pretty good crop. He declares the jacket isn&#8217;t Jernyngham&#8217;s;
he won&#8217;t allow the man can be in the muskeg. A
day or two after Jernyngham disappeared he bought
one of the new wide-swath binders. Paid the money
down in new bills, which was what Jernyngham had,
though the implement agent didn&#8217;t note the numbers.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty strong points. What&#8217;s your private opinion?
Out with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s tone was commanding and Curtis complied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the whole, I&#8217;m inclined to blame the other fellow,
Wandle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Against the evidence?&#8221; asked his superior in quiet
surprise. &#8220;You of course remember your instructions
and know what your duty is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Curtis. &#8220;Still, I think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
paused and continued diffidently: &#8220;You would have an
answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other leaned back in his chair with a meditative
expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let it go at that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Perhaps you had
better follow the waiting course you seem to have decided
on, but if suspicion gathers round Prescott it won&#8217;t be a
drawback and you needn&#8217;t discountenance it. For one
thing, it may divert attention, and after all he may be
the right man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A look of comprehension shone in the corporal&#8217;s eyes.
He believed that his superior, who never expressed a
strong opinion prematurely, agreed with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose either of the men lights out?&#8221; he suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to guard against it. If it happens, apply
for a warrant and follow him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The officer returned to Regina the next day; and a
week or two, during which Curtis and his assistants
laboriously searched the drying swamp, passed uneventfully.
Then one morning Prescott sat somewhat moodily
in the saddle of his binder which a powerful team hauled
along the edge of the wheat. The great stretch of grain
blazed with color as it swayed with a harsh rustle of
warm-tinted ears before the breeze, but now and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
broad cool shadows sped across it as the white-edged
clouds drove by. Behind him followed two more teams
and machines, half covered by falling sheets of yellow
grain, while their whirling wooden arms flashed in the
dazzling sunlight as they flung out the sheaves. Bare-armed
and very scantily attired men came after them,
piling the stocks together. Disturbed as he was, Prescott
felt cheered by the prospect of harvesting a record crop.
</p>
<p>He had turned a corner and was proceeding along
another side of the great oblong when he noticed a wagon
approaching, carrying two strangers and several large
trunks. As their dress differed from that usually worn
on the prairie, he wondered who they were and why they
were driving toward his ranch. The liveryman, who held
the reins, presently pulled up his team and Prescott;
stopping his binder, waited to be addressed. An old
soft hat fell shapelessly forward over his deeply bronzed
face, his neck and most of his arms were uncovered.
Before him the four powerful horses stood fidgeting in
the heat, a black cloud of flies about their heads. Though
not a man of striking appearance, he was in harmony
with his surroundings, and formed a fine central figure
in the great harvest field: a worthy type of the new nation
that is rising in the West.
</p>
<p>For a moment or two the strangers studied him carefully
from the wagon. The one nearest him was a woman
of thirty, he thought, of tall and chastely lined figure, with
a colorless and rather expressionless face, though her
features were excellent. She wore a tight-fitting dark
dress which seemed to have been made all in one piece,
and gave an impression of prim coldness and careful
restraint. The man in the soft hat was obviously her
father. He had gray hair; his face, which was finely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
chiseled, suggested a formal, decided, and perhaps domineering,
character; his gray tweed traveling suit was immaculately
neat. There was no doubt that they were
English, and Prescott wondered whom they reminded him
of, until the truth flashed upon him with a disconcerting
shock&mdash;they were Jernyngham&#8217;s father and sister!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Prescott?&#8221; inquired the man.
</p>
<p>Prescott bowed, and the teamster, jumping down,
handed him two cards.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that you knew my unfortunate son,&#8221;
the newcomer continued.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; Prescott replied guardedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then can I have a word or two with you in private?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Getting down from the binder, Prescott helped the
other to alight from the high wagon; the man was not
agile, though he carried himself well. They walked back
some distance along the edge of the wheat. Then the
rancher stopped and from force of habit felt for his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must be to some extent confidential,&#8221; began
Jernyngham. &#8220;You must guess why I came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The strong light fell searchingly on his face, revealing
lines on it which Prescott thought had lately been
deepened by pain, but his eyes were very keen and hard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose the recent calamity brought you,&#8221; the
rancher ventured.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I have come to see justice done. But we will not
discuss that yet. We arrived yesterday evening and found
it was impossible that my daughter should be comfortable
at the hotel; besides which, it is rather too far away. I
accordingly determined to look for quarters at one of the
ranches, but succeeded in getting shelter for only the one
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott felt amused. Jernyngham and his daughter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
were not the kind of people the somewhat primitive
prairie ranchers would welcome; their request for accommodation
was more likely to cause astonishment and
alarm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;People are very busy, now that harvest&#8217;s coming on,
and they&#8217;ve extra hands to cook for,&#8221; he explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; continued Jernyngham, &#8220;that my son&#8217;s
homestead is in this neighborhood, and domestics might
be hired; but after what has happened, I fear my daughter
would find living there a painful strain. That was why
I thought of applying to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The announcement filled Prescott with dismay. The
presence of the Jernynghams might involve him in further
complications.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but we live very simply,&#8221; he said hastily.
&#8220;My place is only half furnished; we have no time to
make it comfortable&mdash;and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d find our cooking
barbarous. I&#8217;m afraid Miss Jernyngham couldn&#8217;t put
up with the accommodation we could offer her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We only want quietness, fresh air, and a little privacy,
none of which seems to be obtainable at Sebastian. While
the question of terms is no consideration, I recognize that
I must make my appeal to your generosity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott did not answer, and Jernyngham resumed in
a more urgent tone:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must beg you not to make difficulties; I&#8217;m told there
is nobody else in the neighborhood who could take us in.
We will require very little attention and will promise to
give you no trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott wavered. The man was keenly anxious; it
was hard to resist his appeal, and there was, after all,
only a small risk that he might hear of Colston&#8217;s visit.
Svendsen and his wife, who attended to the housekeeping,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
were Scandinavians, and could scarcely converse in English.
When they addressed him by any distinguishing
epithet it was always as &#8220;Boss.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said doubtfully, &#8220;I can&#8217;t refuse you shelter.
You can stay for a while, anyway, until we see how we
get on. I&#8217;ll go up to the homestead with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had an interview with his housekeeper, who protested
in broken English that harvest was a singularly
inconvenient time to entertain strangers, but eventually
gave away. The extra hands lately hired could be put
up in the barn, and there were two rooms that could be
spared. Prescott showed his visitors in and afterward
watched with some amusement their surprise when they
sat down to the midday meal with the lightly clad toilers
from the field. During the afternoon and until late in the
evening, he worked hard among the grain, but when the
light was failing and he leaned on a wire fence, hot and
tired after the long day of effort, Jernyngham came
toward him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had very little talk so far,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My
daughter, however, desires me to convey her thanks to
you. She believes she will be perfectly comfortable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was irritatingly formal, his tone was precise, but it
changed as he added:
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you knew Cyril!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Prescott said gravely. &#8220;I was fond of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham seemed to be struggling with some stirring
of his deeper nature beneath the crust of mannerisms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Prescott,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I may tell you that I now
fear I treated the lad injudiciously, and perhaps with
needless harshness. I looked upon extravagance and
eccentricity as signs of depravity. It was a vast relief
when I heard from Colston, whom you may have met;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
that Cyril had prospered and was leading an exemplary
life in Canada.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The blood crept into Prescott&#8217;s face, and Jernyngham
glanced at him curiously before he proceeded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were somewhat hurt that he would not come
home; but after past mistakes I could not urge him, and
it seemed possible that he might change his mind later.
Then the dreadful blow fell&mdash;crushing and filling me with
all the bitterness of useless regret. I had spoken too late;
the opportunity I would not use in time had gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off, and his face had grown white and stern
when he went on again:
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is only one thing I can do, but if needful, I
will devote the rest of my life to it&mdash;that is, to track down
the man who killed my son!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was silent for the next few minutes, and then, after
a few words on indifferent subjects, intended, Prescott
thought, to cover his display of feeling, he turned away,
leaving the rancher smoking thoughtfully.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>A DAY ON THE PRAIRIE</h3>
</div>

<p>A week after Jernyngham&#8217;s arrival at the homestead
he sat among the sheaves in the harvest field late
one afternoon studying a letter which the mail-carrier had
just brought him. His daughter, sheltered from the
strong sunlight by the tall stocked sheaves, was reading
an elegantly bound book of philosophy. Gertrude
Jernyngham had strict rules of life and spent an hour
or two of every day in improving her mind, without, so
far as her friends had discovered, any enlargement of
her outlook. Among her numerous virtues was an affectionate
solicitude about her father&#8217;s health, which was
variable. Though still muscularly vigorous, Jernyngham
was getting an old man, and he had been out of sorts of
late.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you are looking much better than you did
this morning,&#8221; she said, glancing at him after a while.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Jernyngham rejoined punctiliously. &#8220;I
suppose it was the strain of the past few weeks that tried
me, and perhaps I have been doing too much, traveling
backward and forward between here and the muskeg.&#8221;
Then with an effort he banished his painful thoughts and
smiled. &#8220;I wonder how many years it is since I spent
an afternoon in a harvest field! I&#8217;ll confess that I find
much to interest me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude laid down her book and glanced about. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
was of a practical disposition and almost devoid of artistic
susceptibilities, but the richness and color of the scene
impressed her. Far away in front ran the long ranks of
sheaves, gleaming in the sunshine amid the golden stubble
which was flecked by their deep-blue shadows. The
air was cooling, but the light was brilliant and the standing
wheat was picked out with tints of burnished copper.
By comparison with it, the oat stocks shone pale and
silvery. Round the edge of the grain moved the binders,
clashing and tinkling musically, while their whirling arms
flashed in the sunlight.
</p>
<p>Prescott, lightly clad, drove the foremost machine.
The fine modeling of his lean, muscular figure was effectively
displayed; his uncovered arms and face were
the color of the soil. Seated behind the big horses, he
looked wonderfully virile. The man seemed filled with
primitive vigor; he was a type that was new to Gertrude
Jernyngham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our host,&#8221; remarked her father, &#8220;strikes one as
tireless; though I&#8217;m inclined to think that during
harvest everybody here works at a higher tension than
would be borne at home. Their methods are rather
wasteful&mdash;this tall stubble, for instance, continuous cereal
crops, except for the short summer fallow&mdash;but they&#8217;re
no doubt adapted to the needs of the country. Having
some experience in these matters, I should say this farm
was excellently managed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In place of answering, Gertrude watched the rancher.
The physical perfection of the man had an effect on her,
though she was essentially prudish.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to drive in to the settlement and send off a
cablegram, though I expect it will be difficult to get a
team,&#8221; Jernyngham resumed, returning to his letter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
&#8220;Cranford wants instructions about a matter of importance
that has cropped up since we left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be wise for you to drive so far,&#8221; Gertrude
said firmly. &#8220;I might go instead; we&#8217;ll speak to Mr.
Prescott about it this evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Shortly afterward there was a harsh clanking sound
and Prescott, pulling up his team, sprang down from the
binder. He became busy with hammer and spanner,
and in a few minutes the stubble was strewn with pinion
wheels, little shafts, and driving-chains. Then, while
his guests watched him with growing interest, he put the
machine together, started his team and stopped it, and
again dismembered the complicated gear. This, as
Gertrude realized, was work that needed a certain
amount of skill. Finally, when the overtaking binders
had stopped near-by, he took out a small shaft and held it
up so that the harvesters could see it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Journal&#8217;s bent; I&#8217;ll have to go get a new piece,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Go ahead with your teams.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After that he unhitched his horses and was leading
them past the place where the Jernynghams sat, when
Gertrude spoke to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you had an accident, and I suppose you
will have to send the broken part to Sebastian. May I
go with the team?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll drive you in to-morrow.
As it&#8217;s a pretty long way, I&#8217;ll try to borrow
a comfortable rig.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went on with the horses and she saw no more of
him that day, but early the next morning he brought up a
light, four-wheeled vehicle, which would carry two people
and had a hood that could be drawn up. Gertrude
thought it a great improvement on the prairie wagon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
and she admired the restive team which he had some
trouble in holding. When she got in, he sprang to the seat
beside her, the horses bounded forward, and they sped out
through a gap in the fence, the vehicle lurching wildly
among the ruts.
</p>
<p>For a while Gertrude was occupied, to the exclusion of
everything else, in trying to keep her place, but when Prescott
turned the team on to a stretch of smooth short grass
she began to look about. It was a clear, cool morning,
the sky was a wonderful blue, and bluffs miles away
showed up with sharp distinctness. In the foreground
the gray grass was bathed in a soft light which was
restful to the eyes. Then Gertrude examined the rig,
as the man had called it, which struck her as remarkably
light and fragile; and the same thing was noticeable
about the harness. The horses moved as if they were
drawing no load, swinging along at a fast and springy trot,
while the vehicle ran lightly up and down the slight undulations,
the wheels jarring now and then into a hollow
or smashing through dwarf scrub. The pace was exhilarating,
the fine air invigorated the girl, and her usual
prim reserve melted away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am fortunate in getting in to Sebastian,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a cablegram it&#8217;s necessary that my father should
send.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to take you,&#8221; Prescott rejoined. &#8220;Is Mr.
Jernyngham in business?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; not as you would understand it. We spend
most of our time in the country, where he manages the
estate. It&#8217;s small, but there are two quarries which need
looking after. Then he&#8217;s director of a company. He
doesn&#8217;t believe that a man should be idle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott smiled. He had read a good deal about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
England, and he could imagine Jernyngham&#8217;s firm control
of his property. His rule would, no doubt, be just,
but it would be enforced on autocratic and highly conventional
lines. His daughter, the rancher thought,
resembled him in some respects. She was handsome
and dignified in a colorless way; she might have been
charming if she were only a trifle less correct in manner
and there were more life in her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, in answer to her last remark, &#8220;that&#8217;s
a notion you&#8217;ll find lived up to here. The man who
won&#8217;t work mighty hard very soon goes broke. It&#8217;s a
truth you in the old country ought to impress on the men
you&#8217;re sending out to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She liked his easy phraseology; which she supposed
was western, and there was nothing harsh in his intonation.
It was that of a well-educated man, and the
Jernynghams were exacting in such matters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there must be something in the air which
makes toil less arduous,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The people I&#8217;ve
met have a cheerful, optimistic look.&#8221; She hesitated, and
added in a confidential tone: &#8220;I like to imagine that
my brother wore the same expression, though he was
always carelessly gay. He seems to have made a capable
rancher. It was a great relief to us when we were told
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott grew hot and embarrassed, but he thought
he could understand how Cyril Jernyngham had entered
on a course of recklessness. It was a reaction against
the overwhelming propriety of his father and sister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you need grieve for your brother yet,&#8221;
he said gravely. &#8220;Although nobody here seems to agree
with me, I find it impossible to believe that he is dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude gave him a grateful look.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear you say so&mdash;there is at least a doubt,
and that is comforting; though I&#8217;m afraid my father
can&#8217;t be made to realize it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you persuade him not to take too much for
granted?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could.&#8221; Gertrude&#8217;s tone was sad. &#8220;He has
been brooding over the dreadful news ever since it reached
us. It has possessed him absolutely; he can think of
nothing else, and there will be no relief for him until
he finds the guilty person, or it is proved beyond all
doubt that the police are mistaken.&#8221; She paused before
she went on. &#8220;If they&#8217;re right, I think I should feel as
merciless as he does. Cyril was my only brother; I
was very fond of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her voice trembled a little, though her eyes were
hard, and Prescott felt sorry for her. She was not of
emotional nature; he could imagine her shrinking from
any display of tenderness. Nevertheless, it was obvious
that she was a prey to fear and grief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So was I,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wonder if I may point out
that he struck me as being different from you and your
father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I know what you mean. Cyril was like my
mother&mdash;she died a long while ago, but I remember her as
gentle, sympathetic, and perhaps more variable than I am.
Cyril was swayed by feeling rather than by judgment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott knew this was correct, but he found his companion
an interesting study. She was wrapped up in
cold propriety; she must have led an uneventful life,
looked up to and obeyed by the small community that
owned her father&#8217;s rule. Romance could not have
touched her; she was not imaginative; but he thought
there were warmth and passion lying dormant somewhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
in her nature. She could not have wholly escaped
the consequences of being Cyril Jernyngham&#8217;s sister.
</p>
<p>Nothing further was said for a while, and presently
the team toiled through a belt of sandy ridges, furrowed
by the wind, where the summits were crested here and
there by small jack-pines. Looking up as they crossed
one elevation, Gertrude noticed a wedge of small dark
bodies outlined against the soft blue sky.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are those?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wild geese; the forerunners of the host that will
soon come down from the marshes by the Polar Sea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But do they go so far?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They cross this continent twice a year; up from the
steaming lagoons on the Gulf to the frozen muskegs of
the North, and back again. They&#8217;re filled with a grand
unrest and wholly free; travelers of the high air, always
going somewhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; responded Gertrude. &#8220;To be always doing
something is good. But the other&mdash;the ceaseless
wandering&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Going on and on, beating a passage through the
icy winds, rejoicing in the sun, seeking for adventure.
Is there no charm in that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked at him uneasily, as if his words had
awakened some half-understood response.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Cyril must have felt something of the kind.
So far it has never stirred me. Isn&#8217;t it wise to hold fast
by what is safe and familiar?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Prescott answered with a
smile. &#8220;I follow the course you mention, because I have
to. It&#8217;s my business to drive the plow, and the hazard of
having a crop hailed out is adventure enough. But I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
don&#8217;t think it should make one hard on the people who
prefer the other thing. After all, they may be right;
the life they take pleasure in may be the best for them,
though it wouldn&#8217;t appeal to you or me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that toleration should be encouraged.
It often means indifference, perhaps a lack of principle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She grasped tightly the rail around the seat, for the
horses plunged down a sandy slope at a wild gallop,
passing at the bottom a horse and buggy in which sat a
man dressed in a dark gray suit, to whom Prescott waved
his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he a clergyman?&#8221; asked Gertrude.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Prescott smiled, &#8220;he&#8217;s a Presbyterian minister.
I suppose you think there&#8217;s a difference?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His companion with unusual forbearance let this pass.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have churches at Sebastian?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Four. I can&#8217;t say they&#8217;re crowded; but, while
we&#8217;re liberal-minded on many points, the flocks won&#8217;t
mix. Strikes me as a pity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a pity; there should be only one strong and
united church in every place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that the right one?&#8221; Prescott&#8217;s eyes twinkled
mischievously. &#8220;You&#8217;re thinking of the one we call
Episcopalian?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Gertrude severely; &#8220;the Church.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;m on pretty good terms with the lot,
but Father Dillon&#8217;s my favorite. For one thing, he&#8217;s a
practical farmer as well as a fine classical scholar. His
crowd, for the most part, are hard-up foreigners; and he
shows them how to build decent homes and put their crops
in. All the same, I&#8217;ve quite a high opinion of the Methodist
and the Presbyterian, who are at the opposite end of
the scale.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>Gertrude showed signs of disapproval.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In these matters, broad-mindedness may be dangerous.
One can&#8217;t compromise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;even the Roman Curia tried it before
the council of Trent, and your people made an attempt to
conciliate the English Calvinists about Elizabeth&#8217;s time;
you were inclined to Genevan Protestantism once or twice
afterward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His companion&#8217;s surprise was evident, and he laughed
as he read her thoughts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;I used to take some interest in
these matters once upon a time. You see, I was at
McGill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;McGill? I seem to have heard the name, but what
does it stand for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott looked amused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that it quite means what Oxford does to
you, but it&#8217;s something of the kind; you might have seen
the fine buildings at the foot of the mountain, if you had
stayed in Montreal. Then we have Toronto; with deference
to the Toronto men, I&#8217;ll compare that to Cambridge.
Still, so far as I understand your English ideas,
there&#8217;s a difference&mdash;our boys go to McGill or Toronto
with the intention of learning something that will open up
a career. They certainly play football and one or two
other games pretty well, but that&#8217;s a very secondary object;
so&#8217;s the acquiring of a polished style. In fact, it&#8217;s not
altogether unusual on this side of the Atlantic to find
university men spending a vacation as waiters in the
summer hotels.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why do they do that?&#8221; Gertrude asked with a
shocked expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For money,&#8221; Prescott answered dryly. &#8220;One gathers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
that the St. Andrew boys did something of the same kind
in Scotland in your grandfather&#8217;s time; and no logical
objection could be made to it, anyway. Isn&#8217;t it a pretty
good test of a man&#8217;s determination? It&#8217;s hard to see why
he should make a worse doctor, engineer, or preacher, because
he has the grit to earn his training by carrying plates,
or chopping trees, which some of our boys take to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was difficult to answer, and Gertrude did not
attempt it; her prejudices were stronger than her powers
of reasoning. Looking southward, she saw the turreted
tops of the Sebastian elevators rising from the sea of grass
like cathedral towers. Their smallness emphasized the
vastness of the plain, which was beginning to have a
stimulating effect on her mind. She thought it might explain
the broadness of her companion&#8217;s views, which,
while erroneous, were becoming comprehensible. He lived
in the open, beyond the bounds of walls and fences,
breathing this wonderful invigorating air. Nevertheless,
he was obviously a man of varied and extensive information,
which struck her as somewhat curious in face of his
severely practical abilities. He could mend harness, plow
a straight furrow, break horses, and strip a complicated
machine. As a new type, he deserved attention.
</p>
<p>After a while they struck into a well-beaten track
which had been graded where it crossed a muskeg. The
rude work, however, had suffered from frost and rain:
the ruts in the hard black soil were deep and there were
dangerous holes. To make matters worse, a big gasoline
tractor, intended to assist in some harvesting operations,
had got into difficulties near the middle of the graded
track. It was making an alarming noise and diffusing
a pungent odor, while two men thrust bits of board beneath
the wheels for it to climb out of the hole on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
Prescott&#8217;s team slackened their pace, jerking their heads
and pricking their ears. They were young range horses
that had roamed over wide spaces, and were badly broken.
</p>
<p>Getting a tight grip on the reins he turned to his
companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t get around&mdash;the muskeg&#8217;s too soft. I&#8217;d
put you down, only that I may not be able to hold the
team after we get past that machine.&#8221; He raised his
voice. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you stop her, boys?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir!&#8221; cried a grimy man. &#8220;Soon as we cut
out the engine she&#8217;d run back into the hole! We&#8217;ve been
here two hours already!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold tight!&#8221; Prescott cautioned Gertrude, and urged
the horses forward.
</p>
<p>As they approached the tractor the noise suddenly increased,
and its wheels spun faster, grinding on the skids.
One of the horses reared, swinging up the pole, which
nearly threw its fellow; then there was a frantic thud of
hoofs against the frame of the vehicle, and the team, swinging
half around, threatened to overturn it into the swamp.
Prescott plied the whip; the beasts plunged. One pair
of wheels left the road, and the rig slanted alarmingly.
A violent crash and jolt followed; Gertrude came near
to being flung out of her seat; and they passed the tractor
and sped across the graded stretch at a furious pace.
Prescott was braced backward, his feet pressed hard
against a bar, his lips tightly set, while Gertrude, shrinking
from the disaster that seemed imminent, wondered
how he swung the panic-stricken beasts clear of the
worst holes. She gasped with relief when they had
passed the muskeg, but the trail was still in a dangerous
state, and Prescott turned the team upon the grass,
where they galloped on while the wheels smashed through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
short scrub, until at last the speed began to slacken.
The horses&#8217; coats were foul and flecked with spume when
Gertrude looked backward and saw the tractor far away
in the distance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve had enough,&#8221; Prescott remarked. &#8220;We
made the last mile at a pretty good clip; I kept them at it.
Guess they won&#8217;t start another circus if we meet a freight
locomotive on the switches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The settlement was reached without further mis-adventure,
and Prescott, as a special favor, secured a separate
table at the hotel, where Gertrude was served with an
excellent meal. Afterward he showed her how to despatch
her father&#8217;s message, and as she turned away the
telegraph operator grinned at Prescott.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are all these high-toned English girls coming
from, Jack?&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have brought another one
this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leaving the man without an answer, Prescott rejoined
his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are there any English people staying near the settlement?&#8221;
she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellow was alluding to Miss Hurst.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Muriel Hurst?&#8221; Gertrude exclaimed sharply. &#8220;Was
she here with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Prescott regretted that she had asked for an
explanation of the operator&#8217;s remarks. &#8220;I once drove
her in; Cyril&#8217;s team was doing something else. But you
said you wanted to visit the drygoods store, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude accompanied him there and when he left her
in the hands of a lady clerk she fancied that she was
favored with somewhat unusual attention on his account.
The man seemed to be a favorite in the settlement. She
spent a tedious afternoon in the hotel parlor while he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
went about the business that had brought him in and the
team rested. It was a relief when he reappeared in time
for supper; and after that they set out again. The sun
set before they reached the homestead, the air grew bracingly
cool, and the prairie rolled away before them, dim
and mysterious, streaked with shadowy blurs of bluffs
until a full moon rose and flooded it with silvery light.
There was strange, deep silence except for the thud of
hoofs which rose and fell in sharp staccato rhythm.
</p>
<p>Gertrude was tired when Prescott helped her down at
the homestead, but all her senses were unusually alert.
She had enjoyed what she felt had been an invigorating
day, and she admitted that, although she by no means
agreed with all the rancher said, his breezy talk had added
to its zest.

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>PRESCOTT MAKES A PROMISE</h3>
</div>

<p>The fortnight that followed Gertrude&#8217;s drive to
Sebastian passed uneventfully, though the minds of
three of the occupants of the homestead were filled with
disturbing thoughts. Prescott spent the time working
hard at his harvest, but he wished that something might
relieve him of his guests, whose presence he found embarrassing,
since it forced him to be continually on his guard.
In spite of this, he was conscious of strong sympathy for
them and did what he could to ensure their comfort. He
was getting uneasy, for he saw that Cyril Jernyngham
had involved him in a maze of complications from which
there seemed to be no escape. It was obvious that appearances
were against him; the evidence that Curtis had obtained
pointed to his being implicated in the death of his
friend, and the painstaking corporal might discover something
more damaging. Prescott fancied that one or two
of his acquaintances who now and then rode across his
farm on different errands returned his greeting with a new
and significant coldness.
</p>
<p>Jernyngham spent much of his time at the muskeg,
encouraging the men who searched it and often assisting
in the work. The whole morass was being systematically
turned over with the spade, but no further discoveries had
been made. In addition to this, Jernyngham rode to and
fro about the prairie, talking to the farmers whom he met
on the trail or found at work in the fields. They were all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
sorry for him, but there was something deterrent in his
sternness and his formal English manner, and they were
less communicative than they might have been. This
was why he failed to learn that the Colstons had stayed at
Prescott&#8217;s homestead, though, for that matter, the fact
was not generally known. The man could not rest; tormented
by regrets for his past harshness, he was bent on
making the only amend he could by hunting down the
slayer of his son. His whole mind was fixed on the task,
and he brooded over it in a manner that aroused his
daughter&#8217;s concern. She dreaded the effect a continuance
of the strain might have.
</p>
<p>Gertrude, however, was relieved of a more pressing
anxiety. Though her father steadfastly refused to entertain
it, she shared Prescott&#8217;s belief that her brother was
not dead. For one thing, Cyril was not the man to
come badly to grief; he had done many reckless things
and somehow escaped the worst results. Illogical as the
idea was, she felt that his luck was good. It was a
comforting reflection and she was sensible of a growing
confidence in the farmer, who encouraged her to
cling to it.
</p>
<p>One afternoon she left the house and strolled across
the harvest fields, which had greatly changed in appearance
since she had first seen them. The oats were
all stooked and stood in silvery sheaves, ready for the
thrasher; the great stretch of wheat had melted down to a
narrow oblong, round which the binders were working.
Gertrude stopped to watch them. The plodding horses,
the bent figures of the men, the play of light on falling grain,
and the revolving arms of the machines fixed her eyes; the
rustle of sheaves, the crackle of stubble, and the musical
tinkle of metal, fell pleasantly on her ears. The mornings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
and evenings were cold now, but the days were hot and
bright, and the scene was steeped in vivid hues: ocher,
lemon, and coppery red below, dazzling blue above.
</p>
<p>Prescott drove the leading binder and when it drew
nearer she followed his movements with careful scrutiny.
She admitted that the man aroused her interest. He was
wonderfully virile, sanguine, and hopeful, with a trace of
what she thought of as the primitive strain; which tended
toward physical perfection; his vigor and muscular symmetry
had their effect on her. Though her father was a
man of means and influence, her circle of acquaintances
had been restricted by the narrowness of his views; and
the men with whom she had been brought into contact
were, for the most part, distinguished rather by unexceptional
morals and sound opinions than by bodily grace
and original thought.
</p>
<p>By disposition as well as training Gertrude was a formalist
and a prude, but she was human and she unconsciously
obeyed a law of nature which ordains the union of
the dissimilar. This was why, having met only men of her
own kind hitherto, she had escaped the touch of passion and
now felt drawn toward one who greatly differed from her.
</p>
<p>After a while Prescott stopped his binder and opened a
box attached to it. He closed it sharply, as if annoyed,
called to one of the men gathering up the sheaves, and
then walked toward the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run out of twine; I&#8217;ll have to get some,&#8221; he explained
to Gertrude.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look tired,&#8221; she said, stopping him. &#8220;You have
been working very hard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel quite as bright as usual,&#8221; he confessed.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the heat, I think, but I&#8217;ve turned out at four o&#8217;clock
every morning since harvest began.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then why not take a few minutes&#8217; rest? I&#8217;ll make
you a cup of tea; I was going in to get some ready. It&#8217;s
an English custom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He indicated his attire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be glad, but I haven&#8217;t time to make myself
presentable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll excuse that.&#8221; Gertrude smiled and added with
unusual boldness: &#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to know that your
dress is really most artistic. It suits you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He bowed to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m flattered. This costume was adopted with a view
to economy and comfort. The worst of a man&#8217;s wearing
smart clothes is that whenever he wants to do anything
useful he has to take them off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a great trouble?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes a lot of valuable time,&#8221; he answered with a
smile.
</p>
<p>They turned toward the house, and after getting the
twine he joined her in a cool, shadowy room. Gertrude
was watching a silver spirit-lamp; near which two dainty
cups and plates were laid out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very pretty outfit,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Is it
English?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I bought it at a big store in Winnipeg&mdash;on Portage
Avenue, I think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the place. So they&#8217;re selling this kind of
thing there! It&#8217;s significant. A few years ago they&#8217;d
have got nobody to buy such truck.&#8221; He picked up a
cup and held it to the light after examining the chaste
color, design, and stamp. &#8220;Anyway, it&#8217;s English; the
genuine article. I believe the biscuit can&#8217;t be imitated.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude had not expected him to understand artistic
china.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve read about these things,&#8221; he explained with a
good-humored laugh; &#8220;and I&#8217;ve a way of remembering.
We have time in winter, and one is glad to study anything
that comes along. Still, I&#8217;ll allow that I found five-cent
cans quite good enough when I first came out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was not a point of much importance, but it fixed
Gertrude&#8217;s attention. She was in the habit of roughly
sorting people into different groups; there were, for example,
those who appreciated beautiful things and had been
endowed with them as a reward of merit, and those of
coarser nature on whom they would be wasted, which
was, no doubt, why they had none. Yet here was a man
with artistic taste, who was nevertheless engaged in hard
manual labor and had drunk contentedly out of common
cans. It did not fit in with her theories.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose this country has its influence on one?&#8221;
she said, searching for an explanation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so; the influence is strong and good, on the
whole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She considered this, quietly studying him. It was the
first time she had entertained at table a man in outdoor
working attire; Prescott, out of deference to his guests,
had made some preparation for the meals they shared.
Still, the simple dress became him; he was, as she vaguely
thought of it, admirable, in a way. His hands and wrists
were well-shaped, though scarred and roughened by the
rasp of the hot straw. The warmth of the sun seemed to
cling to his brown face; a joyous vitality emanated from
him, and he had mental gifts. She felt lightly thrilled by
his propinquity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But everything out here is still very crude,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where our strength lies; we&#8217;re a new people,
raised on virgin soil out in the rushing winds. We haven&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
simmered down yet; we&#8217;re charged with unexhausted
energies, which show themselves in novel ways. In our
cities you&#8217;ll find semibarbarous rawness side by side with
splendor and art, and complicated machines run by men
who haven&#8217;t much regard for the fastidious niceties of
civilization, though they&#8217;re unexcelled in their engineering
skill. We undertake big works in an unconsidered
manner that would scare your cautious English minds,
make wild blunders, and go ahead without counting the
damage. We come down pretty hard often, but it never
brings us to a stop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He saw that she did not grasp all he meant to convey,
and he leaned back in his chair with a laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the kind of fool talk you would expect from a
boastful Westerner, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied somewhat formally; &#8220;that isn&#8217;t what
I thought. I find everything I see and hear interesting,
but there&#8217;s much I can&#8217;t understand. One has to feel for
its meaning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very proper attitude,&#8221; he rejoined with amusement.
&#8220;So long as you don&#8217;t bring over a ready-made
standard to measure our shortcomings by, we&#8217;ll explain all
we can. In fact, it&#8217;s a thing we&#8217;re fond of doing.&#8221; Then
his tone grew grave. &#8220;But I haven&#8217;t seen your father
since this morning. Is he at the muskeg?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;m getting anxious about him; the trouble is
preying on his mind. Grief, of course, is a natural feeling,
but he thinks of nothing except revenge. He&#8217;s growing
haggard and losing his judgment. I&#8217;m almost afraid
to think what may happen if he finds anything that looks
like a clue. The shock has shaken him terribly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel half guilty because I&#8217;ve been so calm since I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
came here, but I can&#8217;t believe the worst. You have
reassured me.&#8221; She paused and added softly: &#8220;And
I&#8217;m very grateful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad.&#8221; Prescott&#8217;s tone was sympathetic. &#8220;But
I can imagine what your father feels. From a few things
he has told me, he seems to have led a smooth, well-ordered
life; no doubt he made too much of the trouble
your brother caused him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I think so now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he half-consciously formed an idea that things
would always go tranquilly with him, and when it came
without warning the shock of Cyril&#8217;s disappearance was
too strong. And yet I firmly believe he&#8217;s mistaken in
his fears.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude made a sign of agreement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing I can say calms him. One can only wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s always hard,&#8221; Prescott said gently.
</p>
<p>She roused him to strong compassion. She had,
he thought, no great depth of character, but her development
had been checked by many restraints. Her father
had curbed each natural impulse, until the little originality
in her withered and died; she had grown up
cold and colorless, with narrow views, and petty, if quite
blameless, aims. Prescott, however, was wrong in crediting
Jernyngham with too great a success. Gertrude&#8217;s
nature had not been utterly repressed and stunted, and
now, in time of stress, it was expanding.
</p>
<p>Romance had come late to her, but she was dimly conscious
of it at last. Her senses were stirring and she
felt a half-guilty pleasure at seeing the bronzed rancher&#8217;s
eyes bent on her tenderly. To think of him except as
her host for a few weeks was, of course, folly; but there
was a fascination in the gentleness he showed her. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
was beginning to understand and sympathize with Cyril&#8217;s
rash daring and contempt for restraints. She felt
tempted to follow her impulses; her frigid reserve was
melting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you have more tea?&#8221; she asked, shrinking back
to safe ground.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said, holding out the dainty cup.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hot water? It&#8217;s rather strong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I had a housekeeper we made it black and
drank it by the kettleful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the effect on your nerves!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nerves?&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;We don&#8217;t cultivate them in
this country. Mine make no trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re to be envied,&#8221; she said, and looked up sharply
at a sound of footsteps as her father came in.
</p>
<p>His clothes were dusty and creased; the neatness which
had characterized him on his arrival had gone. His face
had grown brown, but it was haggard, hotly flushed, and
beaded with perspiration; his lips were tightly set, his
eyes had an ominous glitter. Throwing down a riding
quirt he carried, he sat down; resting his arms on the
table, in an attitude of blank dejection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing yet,&#8221; he said listlessly. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to bear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a suggestion I want to make.&#8221; Prescott
spoke quietly. &#8220;The offer of a reward here has led to
nothing; send another round to the Alberta and British
Columbia papers, with a description of your son, saying
you&#8217;ll pay a hundred dollars for trustworthy information
about him. I believe it will bring you good news.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham turned to him in keen impatience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be useless&mdash;my son is dead! The police
have proved that beyond a doubt, and I cannot understand
why you should persist in denying it!&#8221; His eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
grew hard with sudden suspicion. &#8220;It looks as if you had
some motive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re hardly just,&#8221; Gertrude broke in.
&#8220;Mr. Prescott only wishes to lessen your anxiety, but
he&#8217;s convinced of what he says.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a rare thing for her to oppose him, but Jernyngham
was too preoccupied to be surprised at her boldness,
and he made a gesture of deprecation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must forgive me, Mr. Prescott&mdash;my daughter&#8217;s
right. But to offer me assurances that must prove false
is rank cruelty. I have faced the worst; I&#8217;m not strong
enough to bear a second blow, which is what must follow
if I listen to you. As it is, the strain is merciless.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His voice and bearing showed it. Indeed, one could
have imagined that it would have been better had he
yielded a little more, but his eyes expressed a grim, vengeful
determination. He was not the man to weaken, he
would hold out until he broke down; but his daughter
and Prescott were filled with fears for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said the rancher. &#8220;Has Curtis thought
of anything new?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Jernyngham answered harshly. &#8220;The police
can entertain only one idea at a time; they can read the
meaning of footprints and there their ability ends. They
have no power of organization; I can&#8217;t force them to make
investigations on a proper scale, and I&#8217;m helpless until
harvest&#8217;s over. Then, when men can be hired, I&#8217;ll have
every bluff and ravine in the country searched. If I
spend the rest of my life here, I&#8217;ll find the guilty man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He said nothing further, and there was a strained silence
while he sat, leaning forward limply, with bent head,
and a thin hand clenched hard upon the table. Rousing
himself by and by, he took the cup of tea Gertrude passed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
to him, and set it down without drinking. It made a
sharp clatter, but he left it setting near him as if he had
forgotten it. Unable to bear the sight of his distress,
Prescott went quietly out, and when he was leaving the
house Gertrude joined him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I should have stayed with him, but I was
afraid to speak,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Besides, there was nothing
to be said.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This can&#8217;t go on,&#8221; Prescott declared. &#8220;It&#8217;s too much
for him. I can&#8217;t leave here until the harvest&#8217;s over, and
then the grain ought to be hauled in, but I&#8217;ve thought of
making a tour of inquiry along the new railroad and round
the Alberta ranches and the mines in British Columbia.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude looked grateful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a great relief to feel that something was
being done. But&mdash;&#8221; she added hesitatingly, &#8220;your time
is valuable and there would be expense. I have some
means, Mr. Prescott, and though I dare not speak to
my father about it, you must draw on me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk about it later. I wish I could go now, but
that&#8217;s impossible, and there&#8217;s no use in suggesting that
Mr. Jernyngham should send somebody else. Besides,
I believe I&#8217;d have the best chance of picking up the right
trail. You won&#8217;t mind my saying that I&#8217;m very sorry
for you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her eyes grew soft and her whole expression gentle.
It was an attractive face Prescott looked into.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I value your sympathy,&#8221; she said softly. &#8220;Indeed,
I can&#8217;t tell you what a comfort you have been. But you
will undertake this search as soon as possible, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Prescott replied firmly; &#8220;you can count on that.
If I&#8217;ve made things easier for you, I&#8217;m very glad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he turned away and hurried back to the binder.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>A NEW CLUE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a clear, cool morning and Prescott was busily
engaged throwing sheaves into his wagon. He had
finished his harvest and, in accordance with western
custom, had immediately begun the thrashing. Part of
the great field was already stripped to a belt of tall
stubble, though long ranks of stooks still stretched across
the rest, and dusty men were hard at work among them.
Wagons rolled through the crackling straw&mdash;going slowly,
piled high with rustling loads; returning light, jolting
wildly, as fast as the teams could trot, for the thrashers
were paid by the bushel and would brook no delay. In
the background stood their big machine, pouring out a
cloud of smoke that stretched in a gray trail across the
prairie, and filling the air with its harsh clatter.
</p>
<p>It was a scene of strenuous activity, filled with hurriedly
moving figures, but its coloring had lost something of its
former vividness. The blue of the sky was softer, the
light less strong; the varying hues of lemon and copper
and ocher had become subdued; the shadows were no
longer darkly blue but a cool restful gray. The rushing
winds that had swept the wide plain all summer had come
to rest; the air was sharp and still.
</p>
<p>The last week or two, however, had brought no change
to the inmates of the homestead. Jernyngham still
brooded over his loss and worried the police, his daughter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
looked to her host for comfort, and Prescott did what
he could to cheer her. Gertrude, indeed, was sensible
of a rapidly growing confidence in him and of the abandonment
of many long-held ideas. The man was not of
her station: he was a working farmer, his views at first
had jarred on her; and yet the attraction he had for her
was steadily increasing. She made a feeble fight against
it. In England she had stood on safe ground, hedged in
by conventions, ruled by the opinions of a narrow circle of
friends. Now all was different; she had lost these supports
and restraints and she was helpless without them.
Passion was beginning to touch her and she mistook the
rancher&#8217;s gentleness and sympathy.
</p>
<p>When Prescott had loaded his wagon she joined him
as he led his team between the ranks of stooks, but while
she walked by his side he thought of another Englishwoman
whom he had once brought home with the prairie
hay. He remembered how Muriel Hurst had nestled
among the yielding grass, with something delightful in
every line of her figure. He recalled her bright good-humor,
the music of her laugh, the soft tones of her
voice, the hint of courage he had seen in her eyes; and
there was pain in the recollection. Gertrude Jernyngham
was powerless to move him as Muriel had done,
but he was sorry for Cyril&#8217;s sister and very considerate
of her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have the crop off the ground before long,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Then I&#8217;ll start for Alberta, as I promised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be away some time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so. It&#8217;s a big province, though there are
not a great many settlements in it yet; and I may have to
cross over into British Columbia.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude looked down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is very generous of you to go, but I shall miss you.
I shall feel as if I had lost my chief support.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, I&#8217;ve done nothing but talk; and talk is cheap,&#8221;
he laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have given me courage,&#8221; she said with shy hesitation.
&#8220;And sympathy is worth a good deal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not respond as she thought he might have done,
and she continued:
</p>
<p>&#8220;If my father had been less obstinate, you need not
have gone; he could have hired a professional inquiry
agent. But you had better not say anything about your
object to him&mdash;it must be a secret between us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Prescott thoughtfully, &#8220;I guess that
would be wiser. You want to keep his mind at rest as
far as you can. Of course, there&#8217;s a big chance that I
may fail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude turned to him with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! You are not one to fail!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott was slightly embarrassed. He had a feeling
that he was being gently led on toward a closer acquaintance
with his companion. She was dropping the
reserve she had at first displayed and seemed to invite
him tacitly into her confidence. He admitted that this
idea might be incorrect, but it had troubled him once or
twice before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect you&#8217;ll be comfortable enough while I&#8217;m
away,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mrs. Svendsen&#8217;s trustworthy, and
everything will be quiet after the harvesters have gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude did not answer, and they went on in silence
to the noisy separator. Perspiring men, stripped of
their heavier garments, were tossing the sheaves amid
a cloud of dust; cleaned grain poured out into open
bags, and as each was filled two panting toilers flung it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
into a wagon. Near-by stood a great and growing pile
of bags, over which the short straw would be spread a
number of feet thick, to form a granary. Gertrude
joined her father, who was standing near the machine,
moodily looking on, and before Prescott had unloaded
his wagon Curtis rode up with Private Stanton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing new at the muskeg, sir,&#8221; he reported to
Jernyngham rather curtly, and walked his horse
toward Prescott.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were passing,&#8221; he told him, and indicated the
pile of grain. &#8220;You&#8217;re not selling right away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;m not ready to haul the crop in to the elevators
yet. I&#8217;ve one or two more pressing things to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mayn&#8217;t you miss a chance? Prices are pretty good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott was on his guard; he felt that Curtis suspected
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I guess they won&#8217;t fall
much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your neighbors mean to sell, though it&#8217;s quite
likely that&#8217;s to meet their bills, and you always tried to
get in on the first of the market until this year. It
must have cost you a pile to put in that big crop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how have you got so prosperous since last fall?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a pointed question, because everybody in the
district knew that Prescott had sold only a few head of
cattle and a horse or two, while he would shortly have
his accounts to meet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a matter of management,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been working on a different system this spring, and I
find it pays.&#8221; Then he looked steadily at the corporal,
&#8220;Besides, running Jernyngham&#8217;s place along with mine
made it easier to cut expenses.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great crop. But we must be getting on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He rode off and when they had left the stubble,
Private Stanton looked at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;His being able to hold his wheat; which he couldn&#8217;t
do last year, is a pretty strong count against the man.
You gave him his chance for explaining and he made a
mighty bad show. Looks as if he&#8217;d got some money he
couldn&#8217;t account for since last fall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not proved,&#8221; returned Curtis. &#8220;There&#8217;s something
in what he said. Anyway, he isn&#8217;t afraid of us, since
he&#8217;s putting up his grain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite catch on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re young. A guilty man would have rushed
his crop into the elevators and had his money ready to
light out with. If Prescott pulls out suddenly, he&#8217;ll
have to leave his property behind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing&#8217;s between him and Wandle,&#8221; Stanton
persisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like that. Anyway, as the Austrian&#8217;s at the
settlement, we&#8217;ll have a good look round his homestead.
It&#8217;s possible that we&#8217;ll find something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What made you think of searching the place again?
Anything in the last instructions you got from Regina?
You didn&#8217;t show them to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. It isn&#8217;t a part of my duty to consult you,
and you&#8217;re a bit of a hustler. However, this is what I
heard&mdash;a land agent in Navarino sent for the district
sergeant; told him he&#8217;d run across a man from Sebastian
at the hotel and the fellow got talking about Jernyngham.
It was the first the land agent had heard of the matter;
but he was struck by the date on which Jernyngham disappeared,
because he&#8217;d had a deal with him three days later.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mighty strange. If he&#8217;s right, Jernyngham
couldn&#8217;t have been killed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hustle!&#8221; said Curtis. &#8220;The fellow showed
the sergeant the sale record, but he described Jernyngham
as a big, rather stout man with light hair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wandle!&#8221; exclaimed Stanton. &#8220;Are you going to
arrest him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet. We might get him sent up for fraud and
forgery, but if he had anything to do with knocking
Jernyngham out, he&#8217;ll be more likely to give us a clue of
some kind while he&#8217;s at large.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They rode on and reaching Wandle&#8217;s farm searched
the house carefully, replacing everything exactly as they
found it. They discovered nothing of importance, but
as they went out Curtis glanced at the ash and refuse
heap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We might have thought of that earlier,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of people trying to burn up things it might
be dangerous to leave about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Setting to work with a fork and shovel, they presently
unearthed a rusty iron object which Stanton picked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like a big meat can,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Kind
of curious that Wandle should double it over this way
and flatten it down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis took it from him and examined it carefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a meat can; top edges are turned over a
wire&mdash;here&#8217;s a bit sticking out&mdash;and it&#8217;s had a handle.
There&#8217;s a hinge in another place. The thing has been
a box&mdash;a cash-box, I guess&mdash;one of the rubbishy kind
they sell for about a dollar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what would make a man smash up his cash-box?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; guess it doesn&#8217;t apply. I could understand
his wanting to get rid of one that belonged to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
somebody else, after he&#8217;d cleaned it out. Aren&#8217;t you
beginning to understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Stanton eagerly. &#8220;The box was Jernyngham&#8217;s&mdash;we&#8217;ll
find out when he bought it at the hardware
store. Then we&#8217;ll get after Wandle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You hustle too much!&#8221; Curtis rebuked him, and then
sat down with knitted brows. &#8220;Now see here&mdash;in a
general way, it&#8217;s convictions we&#8217;re out for; you want to
count on your verdict before you arrest a man. It comes
to this: he&#8217;s tried first by us, and if he&#8217;s to be let off, it
saves trouble if we decide the thing, instead of leaving
it to the jury. They won&#8217;t tell you that at Regina, but,
in practise, you&#8217;ll find that a police trooper is expected
to use some judgment. Still, there are exceptions to
what I&#8217;ve said about holding back. In the interests of
justice, one might have to corral an innocent man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that going to serve the interests of justice?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The corporal&#8217;s eyes twinkled with dry amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For one thing, it might lead the fellow we were
really after to think we hadn&#8217;t struck his trail. But
that&#8217;s not the point. How much ash would you figure
Wandle takes out of his stove each time he lights it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About a bucketful, burning wood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite, but there&#8217;s a bucket yonder. See how
many times you can fill it with the stuff we shoveled off,
while I take a smoke. Build up the pile to look as if we
hadn&#8217;t disturbed it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stanton did as he was bidden, counting each bucketful
he replaced, and then Curtis sent him to clean out the
stove and estimate the quantity of ash before he put it
back. Then he made a calculation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Allowing for some of the ash slipping down the pile
and for our having moved a little that was there before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
Wandle threw the cash-box in, it fixes the time he did
so pretty close to Jernyngham&#8217;s disappearance,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;Looks bad against the Austrian, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have quite as much against Prescott.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Curtis admitted regretfully; &#8220;that&#8217;s the trouble.
It isn&#8217;t quite so easy being a policeman as folks seem to
think. Now we&#8217;ll ride along and call on the hardware
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They mounted and soon afterward saw a buggy
emerge from the short pines on the crest of a distant rise,
whereupon Curtis rode hard for a poplar bluff, which he
kept between himself and the vehicle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like Wandle coming back,&#8221; he said to Stanton,
who had followed him. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see any reason he
should know we&#8217;ve been prospecting round his place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Reaching the settlement they visited the hardware
dealer, who remembered having sold Jernyngham a
small cheap cash-box about twelve months earlier. On
being shown the bent-up iron, he expressed his belief
that it was the article in question.
</p>
<p>A day or two after the corporal&#8217;s discovery, the mail-carrier
left some letters at the Prescott homestead, and
when it was getting dusk Gertrude strolled out on the
prairie, thinking of one she had received. After a while
Prescott joined her and she greeted him with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My team was looking a bit played out and the boys
will be able to keep the separator gang going as long as
they can see,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you feel that you have to make excuses for stopping
work, after twelve hours of it?&#8221; Gertrude asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he laughed; &#8220;I do feel something of the kind.
There&#8217;s so much to do and the days are getting shorter
fast.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>He glanced at her with appreciation. She wore a thin,
black dress made after the latest London mode, which
showed to advantage the graceful lines of her tall figure;
the Jernynghams, who seldom departed from an established
custom, changed their attire every evening.
Gertrude had on no hat, and the fading light shone into
her face. It was finely cut but cold, the features unusually
good. She was a handsome woman, but she
lacked warmth and softness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a difficulty,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;Perhaps you can
help&mdash;you&#8217;re a man of many resources.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to do what I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are expecting a visit from three old friends of
ours who heard in America of the trouble we are in and
want to see us. What can we do with them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t room,&#8221; Prescott answered. &#8220;But let me
think&mdash;Leslie has quite a big house, and it&#8217;s only three
miles from here. Now that he will have got rid of the
harvesters, he might be willing to take your friends in.
He and his wife are pleasant people; but I think you
met her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I knew you wouldn&#8217;t fail us,&#8221; Gertrude said
gratefully. &#8220;But, after all, I feel inclined to wish they
were not coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was an elusive something in her tone which did
not escape Prescott&#8217;s notice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you wish that?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s difficult to explain, but we have
got used to the mode of life here: the few people we meet
seem to understand our feelings, and we have learned to
trust them. Strangers would rather spoil it all; in a
sense, their visit would be an intrusion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott realized that this was complimentary to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
She had made it clear that he was not a stranger, but one
of the people she trusted. The effect was to render him
somewhat embarrassed, but Gertrude resumed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we owe you a good deal. I don&#8217;t know
what we should have done had we fallen into less considerate
hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m yours to command,&#8221; he replied; and they walked
on in silence for a while, Gertrude glancing at him unobtrusively
now and then.
</p>
<p>She did not believe her brother dead&mdash;Prescott had
reassured her; and now she felt strongly attracted by
the rancher. She had thrown off the restraints in which
she had long acquiesced; she was driven by a passion
which was rapidly overpowering her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suggest that the Leslies should take us
all,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Prescott answered gravely; &#8220;I&#8217;d rather keep
you and your father here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re no longer anxious to get rid of us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He colored.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true. I begin to feel I&#8217;m one of the party.
Then, you see, Leslie&#8217;s pretty talkative and agrees with
Curtis. He might have a bad effect on your father; he
might even shake your confidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she begged, &#8220;don&#8217;t labor the explanation.
You are one of the party and our friend.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott bowed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to make that good. I&#8217;m going off to look for
your brother in a few more days, but it will cost me something
to leave the homestead now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had spoken the truth. Until lately the man had
been bereft of all the amenities of life, but he had now
grown to appreciate the society of cultured people; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
task of cheering and encouraging his guests had become
familiar; he might even have been drawn to the beautiful
woman he had comforted had not his heart been filled
with the image of Muriel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But after the summer&#8217;s hard monotonous work, a
change must be nice,&#8221; she suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; in a way. The trouble is that I must leave my
guests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude&#8217;s eyes grew soft as they rested on him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall miss you,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;But you must
go and find out all you can; I&#8217;m afraid the mystery and
suspense are breaking my father down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They walked on in silence for a while, and then
Svendsen appeared near the homestead, waving his arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks as if I were wanted,&#8221; Prescott remarked; &#8220;I
believe there&#8217;s a wagon to be fixed. Will you excuse
me? I&#8217;ll ride over and have a talk with Leslie in the
morning.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A REVELATION</h3>
</div>

<p>The sun had just dipped, leaving a rim of flaring
color on the edge of the vast plain, when Prescott sat
smoking on the stoop of the Leslie homestead a week
after his evening walk with Gertrude. Leslie and his
wife were simple people from Ontario, who had prospered
in the last few years. Their crops had escaped rust and
hail and autumn frost, and as a result of this, the rancher
had replaced his rude frame dwelling with a commodious
house, built, with lower walls of brick and wood above,
in a somewhat ornate style copied from the small villas
which are springing up on the outskirts of the western
towns.
</p>
<p>Leslie, an elderly, brown-faced man, sat near Prescott;
the Jernynghams, who had driven over to welcome his
friends, were inside, talking to Mrs. Leslie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you don&#8217;t know much about the English people
we&#8217;re expecting?&#8221; Leslie asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Prescott; &#8220;only that they&#8217;re friends of the
Jernynghams. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve even heard their
names yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Leslie knows,&#8221; rejoined the farmer; &#8220;I forget
it. I feel kind of sorry now that she agreed to take them
in, but you made a point of it, and if the man&#8217;s not so
blamed stand-offish, I&#8217;ll have somebody to talk to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t talk too much about Cyril Jernyngham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie looked hard at him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one point, Jack, where I can&#8217;t agree with
you&mdash;you&#8217;re the only man in this district who doesn&#8217;t
believe Jernyngham&#8217;s dead. It strikes me that you
know more about the thing than you have told anybody
yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let it go at that,&#8221; said Prescott awkwardly, &#8220;All
I could say would only bring more trouble on his people,
and they&#8217;ve had quite enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; agreed Leslie, raising his hand in warning.
&#8220;Sh-h! They&#8217;re coming out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next moment Gertrude and her father joined the
men, and after a few words with them stood still, listening.
A long bluff, through which the trail from the settlement
led, ran close up to the homestead, cutting against the
pale green glow of the sky. For a few minutes there
was a deep silence, intensified by the musical clash of cowbells
in the distance, and then a measured, drumming
sound rose softly from behind the trees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess that&#8217;s your friends,&#8221; Leslie said to Jernyngham.
&#8220;Jim&#8217;s made pretty good time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The beat of hoofs grew nearer until the listeners could
hear the rattle of wheels. Then a light, four-wheeled
vehicle came lurching out of the bluff and Jernyngham
hurried down the steps. Prescott had entered the house
to tell Mrs. Leslie, and he came out as the driver pulled
up his team. The occupants of the wagon, which had
run a little past the door, had their backs to him, but
seeing a girl about to alight he sprang forward. Her
head was turned away from him at first, but she glanced
round when he offered to assist her; and he forgot what
the consequences of the meeting must be as he looked into
the eyes of Muriel Hurst. He was conscious of an overwhelming
delight, which showed itself in his shining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
eyes and the warm color that suddenly flushed his face;
Gertrude Jernyngham, standing beside him, read what
was in his heart.
</p>
<p>The effect on Muriel was as marked. He had seized
her hand and as she was standing precariously poised,
ready to descend, he swung her down. Then she
recoiled from him, startled, but with strong relief in her
expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyril!&#8221; she cried in a strained voice. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t
you write and tell us that it was all a mistake? We
heard that you were dead!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Prescott remembered and his heart sank, but he
strove to gather his courage, for there was a crisis to be
faced. He stood silent, with one hand clenched tight,
while Gertrude watched him with hard, unwavering eyes.
Jernyngham, however, had heard Muriel&#8217;s startled
exclamation and hurried toward her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he asked harshly. &#8220;You called my
son&#8217;s name!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl looked at Prescott; troubled and surprised by
the confused emotions his face betrayed. There was
obviously something wrong, but she could not imagine
what it was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I called him Cyril. Why shouldn&#8217;t
I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colston and his wife joined the group, while the driver
looked on from the wagon and the Leslies from the stoop.
Prescott and the girl stood a little distance apart and
Muriel was sensible of a nervous shiver. When Prescott
had first held up his hand to her, she had seen his keen
pleasure and her heart had responded to it; now, however,
she was filled with dismay.
</p>
<p>Jernyngham answered her in curt, stern tones:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one very good reason&mdash;this is not my son!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Cyril!&#8221; Colston broke in. &#8220;But he made us
believe he was; he&#8217;s the man we stayed with!&#8221; He made
a puzzled gesture. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand the thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; replied Jernyngham. &#8220;Is this the man
you wrote to us about?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; said Colston stupidly. &#8220;I thought he
was Cyril; so did we all. We had no cause to doubt it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham turned in fury to the Leslies.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the fellow?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>Prescott braced himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer that&mdash;Jack Prescott. Mr. Colston
stayed at my homestead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you personated my son? I suppose you had
some motive for doing so and must see that we are
entitled to an explanation?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Prescott returned quietly. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t the
place to make it. Hadn&#8217;t you better take your friends
in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They entered the house, which was getting dark,
and while the hired man carried in the baggage Leslie
lighted a lamp in his sitting-room. It was spacious,
roughly paneled in cedar, with an uncovered floor.
There were a few chairs scattered about and a plain
pine table. Jernyngham sat by the table and the
others found seats here and there, except Prescott, who
stood quietly opposite the old man. At a curt sign from
Jernyngham, Leslie and his wife left the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Prescott,&#8221; Jernyngham began, &#8220;you have deceived
my friends here and I think they should remain
to hear what you have to say, but I will dismiss them
if you prefer it. You are responsible to me and I must
ask for a full account of your conduct.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>Prescott glanced round the room, which reminded
him of a court. Gertrude Jernyngham&#8217;s eyes were
fixed on him, and there was a hardness that hinted at
cruelty in them; she looked very dignified and cold. Mrs.
Colston he could not see, but her husband seemed disturbed
and uneasy. Muriel leaned forward in her chair,
with wonder, apprehension, and pity curiously mingled
in her expression. All of them were very still, the
silence was disconcerting, but Prescott roused himself
to make what defense he could.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I passed for Cyril Jernyngham at his request,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An extraordinary statement!&#8221; Jernyngham remarked
with ironical incredulity. &#8220;May one ask if he gave any
reasons for wishing you to do so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott hesitated, which counted against him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Cyril had got hurt in a row at the
settlement a few hours before Mr. Colston&#8217;s arrival.
His head was badly cut; he thought it might make a
bad impression.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t sound very convincing. Had he no
better reason?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rancher paused to think. He would not explain
that his friend&#8217;s mode of life would not have borne a
critical examination, but he had a duty to himself and
something must be urged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he meant to hide the fact that he was married.
He did not wish your friends to meet his wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colston started and it was obvious that the others
were keenly interested, but Jernyngham&#8217;s face grew
darker and marked by signs of pain, for he had learned
a little about Ellice. He was struggling with an overwhelming
humiliation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let that pass,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a matter that
cannot be discussed. Was Mr. Colston&#8217;s visit the only
time you personated my son?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly! Nothing would induce me to play the
part again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will be surprised to hear that shortly
after Cyril&#8217;s disappearance a man sold some land of his
at a town farther along the line?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am surprised, but I believe it must have been
Cyril.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then his handwriting must have totally changed,
which I believe is a very unusual thing,&#8221; Jernyngham
rejoined sarcastically. &#8220;I have been shown some
documents which he is supposed to have filled in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott began to realize that appearances were
very strongly against him. He had admitted having
once impersonated his friend and it would be difficult to
convince those who had heard his confession that he had
not done so again, when there was a strong motive for it
in the price of the land.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said firmly; &#8220;if the handwriting wasn&#8217;t
Cyril&#8217;s, I can&#8217;t tell whose it was; it certainly wasn&#8217;t
mine. There&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;m convinced of&mdash;your son is
not dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham looked at him; with the veins on his forehead
swollen and his face tense with anger, but he held
himself in hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have said so often. I did not believe you; I do
not believe you now; but your object in making the statement
is easy to understand. I&#8217;ve no doubt you realize that
you lie open to a very ugly suspicion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; a strained voice broke in. &#8220;That is not just!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Looking up, Prescott saw that it was Muriel who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
spoken. Her eyes were bright with indignation and her
face was hot, but none of the others showed him any sympathy.
Colston&#8217;s face was grave and troubled, his wife&#8217;s
expressionless; Gertrude Jernyngham looked more determined
and more merciless than her father. She sat very
still, coldly watching him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said to Muriel. &#8220;It&#8217;s comforting to
find one person who does not think the worst of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Silence, sir!&#8221; Jernyngham exclaimed with the air of a
judge rebuking a prisoner of whose guilt he is convinced.
&#8220;You cannot be permitted to speak to this lady.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that is a point for Mrs. Colston to decide, but
we&#8217;ll let it drop. Out of consideration for you, I&#8217;ve
answered your questions; but you have gone too far, and
this must end.&#8221; Prescott&#8217;s expression grew as stern as
the old man&#8217;s and he looked about with pride. &#8220;I tell
you it must stop! What right have you to fling these
infamous hints at me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham broke into a harsh laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The part of an innocent man is too much for you to
play; we won&#8217;t force you into it. It will be a favor if you
will have our baggage sent across here; needless to say,
neither my daughter nor I can re-enter your house.&#8221;
Then his self-control deserted him and he broke out in
hot fury: &#8220;I firmly believe you are the man who killed
my son, and you shall not escape!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Colston quietly, &#8220;that is going too far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Making no answer, Prescott left them; and he was
harnessing his horse outside when, somewhat to his astonishment,
Muriel came toward him. A half-moon
hung low above the bluff and the silvery light shone into
her face, showing her warmth of color and the sparkle in
her eyes. He thought she looked wonderfully attractive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
and his heart throbbed faster, but he knew he must hold
himself in hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better go back?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You have
heard what your friends think of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does that matter?&#8221; she exclaimed with feeling.
&#8220;I&#8217;m very angry with them. I can&#8217;t let you go without
saying that I know you could not have done what you
have been wickedly accused of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad. Thank you. It&#8217;s a big relief to feel that
you believe in me. So long as I have that assurance
nothing else counts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry Colston&#8217;s not convinced; I believe he&#8217;s trying to
keep an open mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; said Prescott. &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect much
from him. He&#8217;s the kind of man who&#8217;s guided by appearances
and seldom does anything out of the common.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel disregarded this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you were very foolish in deceiving us. I can&#8217;t
understand yet why you did so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only tell you that it was for Cyril&#8217;s sake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;it could not have been because of
any benefit that you would get! That would never have
tempted you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He read unshaken confidence in her eyes and it cost him
a stern effort to refrain from reckless speech. Muriel
was beautiful, but that was not all: she was generous and
fearless, a loyal friend and a staunch partizan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Prescott confessed, &#8220;when I explained, I was
more afraid of you than of Jernyngham. I wanted to
keep your good opinion, and I wondered whether you had
only given it to me because you thought I was Cyril
Jernyngham. From your friends&#8217; point of view Jack
Prescott is a very different kind of person.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>Muriel blushed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it unpardonable that I was angry when I first found
out the mistake? Try to imagine with what ideas I have
been brought up. But the feeling left me when I saw
how merciless Jernyngham was; his hard words turned
it into sympathy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is something to be thankful for, though it doesn&#8217;t
content me. I think you would be sorry for any one, even
an enemy, who was in trouble and getting hurt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She grasped his meaning and looked at him steadily
with an air of pride.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then must I tell you that I have as much faith in
Jack Prescott as I had in the man whom I supposed to be
Cyril Jernyngham? But you must justify my confidence.
You have been wrongly and cruelly accused; don&#8217;t you
see the duty that lies on you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Prescott answered gravely; &#8220;I have to clear myself.
If there were no other reason than the one you have
given, it would have to be done. It&#8217;s going to be a tough
proposition, but I&#8217;ll get about it very soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that I wish you all success,&#8221; she told him
softly.
</p>
<p>Then she held out her hand and turned away. When
she had gone Prescott went on with his work and after
buckling the last strap he found that he had forgotten a
parcel Mrs. Leslie had asked him to deliver. Hurrying
back to the house for it, he met Gertrude Jernyngham in
the hall and she stopped where the light fell on her, instead
of avoiding him as he had expected. There was
suspicion in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you agree with your father,&#8221; he said boldly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied in a scornful tone. &#8220;You can pose
rather cleverly&mdash;you tricked me into trusting you, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
your ability is limited, after all. When the strain comes,
you break down. Could anything have been feebler than
the defense you made?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was pretty lame, but every word was true.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried with disgust and impatience, &#8220;one
wouldn&#8217;t expect you to say it was false! You don&#8217;t seem
to have anything more convincing to add.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to add nothing. It isn&#8217;t very long since
you were willing to take my word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I was easily deceived,&#8221; Gertrude said bitterly.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you had twice passed yourself off
as my brother, and you can&#8217;t complain if we see an obvious
motive for your doing so the second time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that I stole the price of Cyril&#8217;s land?&#8221;
Prescott asked sternly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, watching him with cruel eyes. &#8220;That,
however, is not the worst.&#8221; She struggled with rising
passion before she resumed: &#8220;I believe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott raised his hand commandingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop! I&#8217;m going away to find your brother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One can understand your going away!&#8221; she flung
back at him as she passed on down the hall.
</p>
<p>Prescott drove home at a reckless pace. Facing the
situation boldly, he recognized that the outlook was very
dark.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>PRESCOTT&#8217;S FLIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>Two days after the arrival of the Colstons, Gertrude
Jernyngham walked down the trail from the Leslie
homestead in a very bitter mood. During the last few
weeks her cold nature had kindled into sudden warmth;
love had most unexpectedly crept into her heart.
At first she had struggled against and been ashamed of
it, for its object was a man beneath her in rank and of
widely different mode of thought; but by degrees the
judgment she had hitherto exercised had given place to
passion. After the narrow, conventional life she had led,
there was a strange exhilaration and excitement in yielding
to her impulses; the virility of Prescott&#8217;s character and
his physical perfection stirred her. She desired him and
had boldly used such charms as she possessed in his
subjugation. Misled by his gentleness, she imagined him
responsive, and then Muriel had appeared on the scene
and the truth was plain to her when she saw his face
light up at sight of the girl. She had read warm love
in his eager glance.
</p>
<p>Now Gertrude was crushed and humbled. She had
cheapened herself, as she thought of it, to this rancher,
only to find that he preferred another. Her punishment
was severe, but she felt that it was deserved, and her
ripening passion had turned to something very much like
hate. Whether he had really had any hand in her
brother&#8217;s death was a point she would not calmly reason
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
out, though she had a half-conscious feeling that he could
not be charged with this. She wanted to think him base:
to believe in his guilt would be an excuse for making him
suffer.
</p>
<p>While she walked, she cast quick glances across the
waste of grass, looking for a mounted figure that did not
appear, until at last she turned with a start at the sound
of footsteps as Muriel came up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you alone and thought I would join you,&#8221;
Muriel said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a relief to be by oneself now and then,&#8221; Gertrude
answered with curt ungraciousness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One can understand that. I tried to give Harry a
hint that our visit might be an intrusion, when he talked
of joining your father; but he thought it would be some
comfort for you to have your friends about you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was some time in putting his idea into practise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We started as soon as we heard of your trouble,&#8221;
said Muriel. &#8220;We were in Mexico then, and as we had
moved about a good deal there was some delay in our
letters. Has your father decided to stay with the
Leslies?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for a while. It was, of course, impossible for
us to remain with Mr. Prescott.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why could you not?&#8221; Muriel asked with sparkling
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it obvious, after what you heard the man
admit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel stopped, the color creeping into her face, which
was filled with anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible that Mr. Prescott could have had any
connection with Cyril&#8217;s disappearance. It&#8217;s wicked and
cruel to suspect him!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You seem strangely convinced of his innocence,&#8221;
Gertrude retorted with a somber glance at her. &#8220;We
shall see by and by whether you or my father is right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They walked on slowly, and shortly afterward two
mounted figures appeared on the plain. Gertrude
watched them draw near, and then turned to her
companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The police; we have been expecting them,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;My father sent a message to the corporal after Prescott
had gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he will be deeply ashamed of his harshness before
long,&#8221; Muriel declared as she abruptly moved away.
</p>
<p>Gertrude let her go with a cruel smile. She thought
she knew how matters stood, and if the girl were suffering,
she had no pity for her. Then she waited until the police
trotted by, and afterward walked slowly toward the house.
On reaching it, she met Curtis coming out and he asked
for a word with her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand you were the last person to see Prescott
when he left this place the other night,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Gertrude admitted it, watching the man. He looked
disturbed, as if he did not know what to think. Private
Stanton was sitting in his saddle with an expressionless
face a few yards away, but she imagined it was intended
that he should hear her answers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Curtis resumed, &#8220;I have to ask what he said
to you; anyway, so far as it bears on the business we have
in hand. You know why I was sent for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude hesitated. She was very angry with Prescott,
and there was a statement he had made which would
prove damaging to him if she repeated part of it without
the rest. She shrank from this course, but her rancor
against the man suddenly grew too strong for her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I must answer that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your duty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she said in a strained voice, &#8220;Mr. Prescott
told me he was going away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Going away!&#8221; Curtis looked astonished. &#8220;I guess
you realize that this is a serious matter. Did he mention
when?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understood it would be very soon.&#8221; Gertrude looked
at the man haughtily. &#8220;That is all I have to tell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She went into the house, feeling that she had said
enough, and Curtis motioned to his companion and rode
away. They had gone some distance when Stanton
turned to his superior.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty significant. What are you going to do about
it?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to apply for a warrant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Curtis went on, &#8220;this thing isn&#8217;t quite so simple
as it seems. To begin with, it&#8217;s my idea that Miss
Jernyngham hasn&#8217;t told us all she knows; you want to
remember that Prescott&#8217;s a good-looking fellow with a
taking manner. I can see complications, though I
can&#8217;t get the right drift of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess the matter will be worse mussed up if Prescott
lights out. Now that Bardsley&#8217;s gone down the line,
you can&#8217;t get your warrant for a day or two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; Curtis agreed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make for the
settlement and wire Bardsley and our bosses at Regina;
you&#8217;ll ride on and keep Prescott in sight&mdash;though it
would be better if you didn&#8217;t let him know you were
watching him. When he clears, take the trail behind
him and send back word to Sebastian. Soon as I get
the warrant or instructions, I&#8217;ll come after you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>They separated and some time later Stanton took
up his station in a bluff which commanded a view
of the Prescott homestead. Lying hidden with his
horse, he saw the rancher drive up and disappear
within the house. Prescott had been very busy during
the past two days and had found strenuous application
something of a relief. He recognized that suspicion
was centering on him and that he might expect a visit
from the police, but the only way of proving his innocence
that he could see was to produce his supposed victim.
He foresaw that it might take a long while to find the
man, and he must make preparations for a lengthy
absence. The risk he ran in remaining until he had
completed them was grave, but there was a vein of dogged
persistency in him and he would not go before he was
ready.
</p>
<p>He had, however, other matters to think of. Miss
Jernyngham had turned against him; after the confidence
she had expressed, he could not understand why
she had done so. Muriel Hurst, however, still believed
in him, which was a comforting thought, though he
would not permit himself to dwell on it. He loved the
girl, but it seemed impossible that she should marry him.
There was so much against this: the mode of life to which
she had been accustomed, his obscure position, the
prejudices of her relations. He blamed himself for not
struggling more determinedly against the charm she
had exerted on him; but it was too late to regret this now.
He must bear his trouble and try to think of her as seldom
as possible, which would be the easier, inasmuch as
the work that waited him would demand his close
attention. As soon as it grew dark that evening, he must
set off on his search for Cyril Jernyngham.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>Dusk was falling when he rode away from the homestead
with a couple of blankets and provisions for a
few days strapped to his saddle. Though he could
trust Svendsen to look after things in his absence, he
was anxious and dejected, and it was with keen regret
that he cast a last glance across the sweep of shadowy
stubble toward the lighted windows of the house. All
he saw belonged to him; he had by patient labor in frost
and scorching sun built up the farm, and he was conscious
of a strong love for it. It was hard to go away, an
outcast, branded with black suspicion, leaving the place
in another&#8217;s charge; but there was no remedy.
</p>
<p>The sky was faintly clouded, the moon, which was
near its setting, obscured; the prairie ran back, dim
and blurred; the air was keen and still. Prescott thought
he heard a soft beat of hoofs behind him. He could,
however, see nobody, and he rode on faster, heading for
the house of a neighbor with whom he had some business,
near the trail to the settlement. After a while he pulled
up, and listening carefully heard the sound again. It
looked as if he were being followed and he thought
that if the police were on his trail, they would expect
him to make for the American frontier, and to do that
he must pass through or near Sebastian. If they believed
this was his object, it might save him trouble, for
he meant to ride north in search of Jernyngham after
calling at the farm.
</p>
<p>Checking his horse, he rode on without haste until it
became obvious that the man behind was drawing up,
then he set off at a gallop. Behind the farm he meant to
visit lay a belt of broken ground, marked by scrub and
scattered bluffs, where it should not be difficult to evade
his pursuer. The staccato thud of the gallop would ring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
far through the still, night air, but this was of no consequence;
he was some distance ahead and his horse was
fresh and powerful. In a few minutes he believed that
he was gaining and when he rode into sight of the little
wooden house, which showed up black against the sky
with one dim light in it, he was seized by a new idea. A
horse stood outside the door, and he supposed the rancher
had just returned. The man was a friend of Prescott&#8217;s
and believed in his innocence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Larry,&#8221; he cried as he rode up, and added when a
shadowy figure came out: &#8220;You can send along your
teams and do that breaking we were speaking of. Svendsen
will pay you when you&#8217;re through with it. I&#8217;m off to
the north.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed the other sharply. &#8220;I guess I know
what you&#8217;re after. It strikes me you should have gone
before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused with a lifted hand as he heard the drumming
of hoofs, and Prescott laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. I believe you&#8217;ll have a police trooper
here in the next few minutes. Your horse is still
saddled?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;ve just come back from Gillom&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then get up and ride for the settlement. Mail an
order for some harness or anything useful to Regina by the
night train, when you get there; you can let Svendsen have
the bill. You had better go pretty fast and keep ahead
of the trooper as long as you can. I guess you understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; grinned the other, and getting into the saddle,
rode away at a smart trot, while Prescott dismounted and
led his horse quietly toward the nearest bluff.
</p>
<p>On reaching it he stopped and, listening carefully,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
heard the rancher riding down the trail to Sebastian, and
another beat of hoofs that grew rapidly louder. By and
by he made out a dim mounted figure that pressed on
fast across the shadowy waste, and for a few anxious
moments wondered whether the policeman would call at
the house and discover its owner&#8217;s absence. He passed
on, however, and was presently lost in the darkness.
When the drumming of his horse&#8217;s hoofs gradually died
away, Prescott mounted and rode hard toward the north.
It would, he thought, be an hour or two before the trooper
found out his mistake; the rancher would not betray
him, and there was a prospect of his getting clear away.

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE CONSTRUCTION CAMP</h3>
</div>

<p>The light was fading when Prescott walked into sight
of the construction camp. It was situated on the
edge of a belt of a muskeg sprinkled with birches and
small pines, where the new railroad, leaving the open
country to the south, ran up toward the great coniferous
forest that fringes the northern portion of the prairie.
Prescott had sold his horse at a lonely farm and he was
now tired and hungry, but he felt satisfied that he was
on the right track and had succeeded in eluding the
police. Curtis and Private Stanton were men of fixed
ideas; believing Jernyngham to be dead, they had, no
doubt, merely made a few perfunctory inquiries at the
nearest railroad camps. Moreover, as they had reason
for concluding that Prescott would seek refuge across
the American boundary, they would concentrate their
efforts on looking for him there. Accordingly, he felt
safe from pursuit.
</p>
<p>By and by he stopped to look about. To the eastward
all was gray, a dim waste of grass dotted with
shadowy trees; but a vivid band of green still glowed on
the western horizon. In front lay a broad shallow basin,
streaked with filmy trails of mist, between which came
the wan gleam of little pools. A causeway stretched out
into the morass, sprinkled with the indistinct figures of
toiling men. At its inner end, where it left the higher
ground, a row of cars stood on a side-track, and near-by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
there were ranged straggling lines of tents and wooden
shacks. Wisps of blue smoke drifted across the swamp,
and a beam of strong white light streamed out from the
electric head-lamp of a locomotive. The still air was
filled with the clink of shovels, the clang of flung-down
rails, and the sharp rattle of falling gravel.
</p>
<p>Going on until he reached the camp, Prescott stopped
beside a group of men sitting about a fire, and loosed
the heavy pack that galled his shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can give me a place to lie down and a bit of
supper, boys, I&#8217;d be obliged,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Two or three of them turned and looked at him
without much curiosity. They were strong, brown-faced
fellows, dressed in old duck overalls and slate-colored
shirts, with shapeless hats and dilapidated
knee-boots.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, certainly,&#8221; responded one in a clean English
intonation. &#8220;However, as we&#8217;re paying for our board,
we&#8217;ll have to invite you as the guest of the construction
contractor; but there&#8217;s no reason you should be shy
about accepting his hospitality. Sit down until Shan Li
brings the grub along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a place,&#8221; said another. &#8220;Want a job?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet,&#8221; Prescott answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking
for a friend of mine: man of middle height, with pale-blue
eyes and a curious twinkling smile. He was wearing a
green shirt of finer stuff than they generally sell at the
settlements when I last saw him, and I expect he&#8217;d have
a fresh scar on his head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was signs of interest and amusement which
suggested that Prescott was on the right track.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he call himself Kermode?&#8221; one of the men
asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>Prescott hesitated. It was possible that some of them
had heard of the Jernyngham affair, and he had no wish
that they should connect him with it. While he considered
his answer, the man with the English accent
broke in:
</p>
<p>&#8220;We needn&#8217;t trouble about the point. One name&#8217;s as
good as another, as our friend Kermode, who seems to
have been a bit of philosopher, remarked when they put
him on the pay-roll.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was back at Nelson a smart policeman rode
into the camp,&#8221; said another of the group. &#8220;Wanted to
know if we had seen the man you&#8217;re asking for; gave us
quite a good description of him. Anyway, I hadn&#8217;t seen
him then, and when I struck him afterward I didn&#8217;t
send word to the police. I&#8217;ve no use for those fellows;
they&#8217;re best left alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you know him?&#8221; Prescott exclaimed eagerly.
</p>
<p>The man looked at his comrades and there was a laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said one of them; &#8220;we know him all right.
Glad to meet a man who&#8217;s a friend of his; but if you
expect a job here, you don&#8217;t want to mention it. If
another fellow of that kind comes along, the boss will
get after him with a gun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kermode,&#8221; the Englishman explained, &#8220;is a man of
happy and original thoughts. I believe I might say he
is unique.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The conversation was interrupted by a steadily increasing
rattle, and a great light that moved swiftly blazed
on the camp. It faded as a ballast-train rolled out upon
the bank which traversed the swamp, with a swarm of
indistinct figures clinging to the low cars. When it
stopped, the sides of the cars fell outward, a big plow
moved forward from one to another, and broken rock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
and gravel, pouring off, went crashing and rattling down
the slope. The noise it made rang harshly through the
stillness of the evening, and when it ceased a whistle
screamed and the clangor of the wheels began again. As
the engine backed the train away, the blaze of the head-lamp
fell on an object lying half buried in the muskeg
about sixty feet below the line, and one of the men,
pointing to it, touched Prescott&#8217;s arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See what that is?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Prescott saw that it was what the railroad builders call
a steel dump: a metal wagon capable of carrying thirty
or forty tons of ballast, with an automatic arrangement
for throwing out its load.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did it get there?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell you after supper,&#8221; said the fellow. &#8220;They&#8217;re
bringing it along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A whistle blew and Prescott followed his companions
into a shed built of railroad ties and galvanized iron.
It was lighted by kerosene lamps which diffused an
unpleasant odor, and fitted with rude tables and benches;
but the meal laid out in it was bountiful and varied: pork,
hard steak, fish from the lakes, potatoes, desiccated fruits,
and tea. The shovel-gang paid six dollars a week for
their board and got good value. As usual, most of them
were satisfied in fifteen minutes, for in the West the rank
and file eat with determined haste, and when they trooped
out Prescott went back with his new friends to the fire.
Taking out his pipe, he made himself as comfortable as
possible on a pile of gravel and, tired with a long day&#8217;s
march, looked lazily about. The strong light still blazed
along the bank where hurrying men passed through the
stream of radiance, vanished into the shadows, and appeared
again. There was a continuous rattling and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
clinking and roar of falling stones; rails rang as they were
moved, and now and then hoarse orders came out of the
darkness.
</p>
<p>After Prescott had asked a few leading questions, the
men began to talk of Kermode, who had already left the
camp, and the rancher was able to put together the story
of his doings there.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The muskeg was an unusually bad one. It swallowed
the rock the men dumped in; logs, brush, and branches
afforded no foundation, and a long time elapsed before
the engineers were satisfied about the base of the embankment.
The weather remained unusually hot until late
in the fall, and the contractor, already behind time and
anxious to make progress before the frost interfered with
his work, developed a virulent temper. His construction
foreman drove the men mercilessly, spurring on the laggards
with scathing words and occasionally using a heavy
fist when they showed resentment. The laborers&#8217; nerves
were worn raw, their strength was exhausted; but the
muskeg must be filled and, while carload after carload
of rock and gravel was hurled down, the line crept on.
</p>
<p>Things were in this state when Kermode reached the
camp and, on applying for work, was given a shovel and
made to use it in a strenuous fashion. It appeared that
he was not expert with the tool and the foreman&#8217;s most
pointed remarks were generally addressed to him, but he
had a humorous manner which gained him friends. Once
or twice, to his comrades&#8217; admiration, he engaged his
persecutor in a wordy contest and badly routed him, which
did not improve matters. Indeed, his last victory proved
a costly one, because afterward when there was anything
particularly unpleasant or dangerous to be done, Kermode
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
was selected. As it happened, the risks that must be
faced were numerous.
</p>
<p>Kermode stood it for some weeks, though he grew thin
and his hands were often bleeding. In spite of this, his
eyes still twinkled mischievously and, when occasion
demanded, his retort was swift and edged with wit. Now
and then he made reprisals, for when, as happened once
or twice, a load of gravel nearly swept the foreman down
the bank, Kermode was engaged in the vicinity. Another
time, the bullying martinet was forced to jump into the
muskeg, where he sank to the waist, in order to avoid a
mass of ballast sent down before its descent was looked
for.
</p>
<p>There was a difference of opinion about the cause of
Kermode&#8217;s holding out. Some of his comrades said he
must have meant to wait for the arrival of the pay car, so
as to draw his wages before he left; others declared that
this did not count with him, and he stayed because he
would not be driven out. The Englishman took the latter
view for, as he told Prescott, Kermode once said to him,
&#8220;I want the opposition to remember me when I quit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By degrees the foreman&#8217;s gibes grew less frequent.
Kermode was more than a match for him, and his barbed
replies were repeated with laughter about the camp; but
his oppressor now relied on galling commands which
could not be disobeyed. Kermode&#8217;s companions sympathized
with him, and waited for the inevitable rupture,
which they thought would take a dramatic shape. At
length two big steel dump cars were sent up from the east
and run backward and forward between the muskeg and a
distant cutting where they were filled with broken rock.
This was deposited in places where the embankment
needed the most reinforcing, but after a while the foreman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
decided that the locomotive of the gravel train need not
be detained to move the cars. They could, he said, be
pushed by hand, and nobody was surprised when Kermode
was among the men chosen for the task.
</p>
<p>Though the nights were getting cold, the days were
still very hot, and those engaged in it found the work of
propelling a steel car carrying about thirty tons of stone
over rails laid roughly on a slight upward grade remarkably
arduous. This, however, did not content the foreman.
He took two men away; and when those whom he
left had been worked to exhaustion, he changed them,
with the exception of Kermode, who was kept steadily
at the task. As a result, he came to be looked on as
leader of the gang, and his companions took their instructions
from him, which the foreman concurred in, because
it enabled him to hold Kermode responsible for everything
that went wrong.
</p>
<p>Then the pay car arrived, and when wages were drawn,
the men awaited developments with interest; but nothing
unusual occurred until a week had passed. Kermode had
had his hand crushed by a heavy stone and meant to rest
it for a day or two, but his persecutor drove him out to
work. He obeyed with suspicious meekness and toiled
in the scorching sun all day; but a few minutes before
the signal to stop in the evening for which they were
eagerly waiting, the gang was ordered to run a loaded
dump car to the end of the line. The men were worn
out, short in temper, and dripping with perspiration.
Kermode&#8217;s hand pained him and in trying to save it he
had strained his shoulder; but he encouraged the others,
and they slowly pushed the load along, moving it a yard
or two, and stopping for breath. The men on the bank
were dawdling through the last few minutes, waiting to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
lay down their tools, and they offered the gang their
sympathy as they passed. Then there was a change in
their attitude as the foreman strode up the track.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shove!&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;Get a move on! You have
to dump that rock before you quit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were ready to turn on him and Kermode&#8217;s eyes
flashed; but he spoke quietly to his men:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Push!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A few more yards were covered, the foreman walking
beside the gang until they stopped for breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get on!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Send her along, you slobs!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re pretty near the top of the grade,&#8221; Kermode
answered him quietly. &#8220;We want to go easy, so
as to stop her at the dumping-place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The line, when finished, would cross the muskeg with
a slight ascent; but the bank sank as they worked at it,
and the track now led downhill toward its end. The
foreman failed to remember this in his vicious mood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to call me down?&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Mean
to teach me my job? If this crowd&#8217;s a sample of white
men, give me Chinamen or niggers! Get on before you
make me sick, you slouching hogs!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He became more insulting, using terms unbearable
even in a construction camp, but Kermode did not
answer him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep her going, boys,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>They made another few yards, gasping, panting, with
dripping faces; and then the work grew easier as they
crossed the top of the ascent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Push!&#8221; said Kermode. &#8220;Send her along!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They looked at him in surprise. It was getting dark,
but they could still see his face, which was quietly resolute;
he evidently meant what he said, and they obeyed him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
The big car began to move more freely, and they waited
for an order to slacken the pace; but their leader seemed
to be increasing his exertions and his eyes gleamed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He told us to push, boys!&#8221; he reminded them. &#8220;Rush
her ahead!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then comprehension dawned on them. The foreman
had dropped behind, satisfied, perhaps, with bullying
them, but every man taxed his tired muscles for a last
effort. The wheels turned faster, the men broke into a
run, and none of them was astonished when a warning
cry rose behind them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; shouted Kermode. &#8220;He&#8217;ll hold me responsible!
You know what to do!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Men along the line called to them as they passed, and
they answered with a breathless yell. The car was
gathering speed, and they kept it going. There were
further warnings, but they held on, until Kermode
raised his voice harshly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;A good shove, boys, and let her go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They stopped, exhausted, but the dump rolled on
with its heavy load of rock, struck the guard-beams at
the end of the track and smashed through them. Then
with a crash and a roar the big steel car plunged down
the slope, plowing up the gravel, hurling out massive
stones. A cloud of dust leaped about it; there was a
shrill ringing sound as an axle broke, a last downward
leap, and with a mighty splash the dump came to rest,
half buried, in the muskeg.
</p>
<p>Kermode turned with a cheerful smile as the foreman
ran up; and the spectators knew that the time for words
had passed. Nobody could remember who struck the
first blow, but Kermode&#8217;s left hand was injured, and he
clinched as soon as he could. For a few minutes the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
men reeled about the track; and then with a tense effort
Kermode pushed the foreman off the bank and went
down with him. The gravel was small and slippery,
lying at a steep slope, and they rolled down, still grappling
with each other, until there was a splash below. A few
moments later Kermode painfully climbed the bank alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you had better go down and pull your boss
out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty soft in the muskeg; I believe
he got his head in, and by the way he&#8217;s floundering it
looks as if he couldn&#8217;t see.&#8221; He paused and waved his
hand in genial farewell. &#8220;Good-night, boys! I&#8217;m
sorry I have to leave you; but considering everything,
I think I&#8217;ll take the trail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he turned and moved down the track, vanishing
into the growing darkness.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When the tale was finished, Prescott sat a while,
smoking thoughtfully. He imagined that he had struck
Jernyngham&#8217;s trail; all that he had heard was characteristic
of the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where Kermode went?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Guess he might have headed for a camp farther
west; I&#8217;ve heard they&#8217;re short of men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott thought this probable and determined to
resume his search in the morning. Presently the gravel
train came back and the stream of light from the head-lamp,
blazing along the embankment, rested on the half-buried
dump. Then there was a roar as the plow flung
the load off the cars, and in the silence that followed one
of the men got up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Morning will come soon enough; I guess it&#8217;s time
for sleep,&#8221; he said.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>ON THE TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>When Prescott got up the next morning, dawn
was breaking across the muskeg. There was
frost in the air, the freight-cars on the side-track and the
roofs of the shacks were white, and a nipping breeze
swept through the camp. It was already filled with
sounds of activity&mdash;hoarse voices, heavy footsteps, the
tolling of a locomotive bell, and the rattle of wheels&mdash;and
Prescott&#8217;s new friends were eating in a neighboring shed.
Going in, he was supplied with breakfast, and when he
left the table the Englishman joined him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you made up your mind whether you want a
job or not?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>Prescott said he thought he would push on, and the
man looked at him deprecatingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we don&#8217;t want to appear inhospitable,
but as things are run here, you&#8217;re the guest of the boss,
and since he didn&#8217;t give the invitation, there might be
trouble if he noticed you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As it happens, I want to get hold of Kermode as soon
as I can,&#8221; Prescott answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have much difficulty in finding him.
It&#8217;s hardly possible for a man of his gifts to go through
the country without leaving a plain trail behind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott agreed with this. He had not much doubt of
Kermode&#8217;s identity, and he thought his missing friend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
would give any acquaintances he made on his travels
cause to remember him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a construction train starting west in about
half an hour,&#8221; resumed the railroad hand. &#8220;If you get
on board with the boys, it will look as if you belonged
to the gang.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Daylight had come when Prescott clambered up on
one of the long flat cars loaded with rails and ties, and in
a few minutes the train started. It followed what was
called a cut-out line, which worked round the muskeg
and back to the main track through a country too difficult
for the latter to traverse; and for a while Prescott&#8217;s interest
was occupied by its progress. Groups of men in
brown overalls were seated on the rails, which clanged
musically in rude harmony with the clatter of the wheels.
A sooty cloud streamed back above them, now and then
blotting out the clusters of figures; the cars swayed and
shook, and in view of the roughness of the line Prescott
admired the nerve of the engineer.
</p>
<p>The wind that whipped his face was cold and pierced
the blanket he had flung over his shoulders; but the sunshine
was growing brighter and the mist in the hollows
was rapidly vanishing. As a rule, the depressions were
swampy, and as they sped across them Prescott could
see the huge locomotive rocking, while the rails, which
were spiked to ties thrown down on brush, sank beneath
the weight and sprang up again as the cars jolted by.
As they rushed down tortuous declivities, the cars
banged and canted round the curves, while Prescott held
on tight, his feet braced against a rail. It was better
when they joined the graded track, and toward noon he
was given a meal with the others at a camp where a
bridge was being strengthened. When they started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
again, he lay down in his blanket where the sunshine
fell upon him and the end of the car kept off the wind,
and lighting his pipe became lost in reflection.
</p>
<p>It was obvious that he must use every effort to find
Jernyngham and he thought he might succeed in this;
but what then? To prove his innocence, in which she
already believed, would not bridge the gulf between him
and Muriel Hurst. It seemed impossible that she should
be willing to marry a working rancher. Yet he knew
that he could not overcome his love for her; there was
pleasure as well as pain in remembering her frankness and
gaiety and confidence in him; and the charm of her
beauty was strong. He recalled the crimson of her lips,
the glow of warm color in her hair, the brightness of
her smile, and the softness he had once or twice seen
in her violet eyes. Then he drove these thoughts away;
to indulge in them would only make the self-denial he
must practise the harder.
</p>
<p>He next tried to occupy his mind with Gertrude
Jernyngham, for he was still without a clue to her
disconcerting change of mood. She had no great attraction
for him, but he had pitied her and found a
certain pleasure in her society. It was strange that
after taking his view of her brother&#8217;s fate against the one
her father held, she should suddenly turn upon him in
bitter anger. He was hurt at this, particularly as he did
not think the revelation that he had personated Cyril
accounted for everything. However, as it was unavoidable,
he thought he could bear Miss Jernyngham&#8217;s
suspicion.
</p>
<p>He was disturbed in his reflections by a sudden jolt of
the train as it stopped at a water-tank. Getting down
with the others, he saw a man standing in the entrance of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
half-finished wooden building. The fellow looked
like a mechanic, and his short blue-serge jacket and
other details of his dress suggested that he was an
Englishman. On speaking to him, Prescott learned
that the train would be detained a while, because a
locomotive and some empty cars were coming down the
line. The man further mentioned that a number of
railroad hands had been engaged in putting up the
building until lately, when they had been sent on somewhere
else, and Prescott inquired if there had been
a man among them who answered to his friend&#8217;s
description.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was,&#8221; said the other dryly, and called to somebody
inside: &#8220;Here&#8217;s a fellow asking for Kermode!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring him in!&#8221; replied a voice, and Prescott entered
the building.
</p>
<p>It contained a pump and two large steel tanks. Near
one of them a man was doing something with a drill, but
he took out his pipe and pointed to a piece of sacking
laid on a beam.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down and have a smoke,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have
plenty of time. Was Kermode a friend of yours?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott looked about the place. He saw that it was a
filtering station for the treatment of water unfit for
locomotive use.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he responded. &#8220;I knew Kermode pretty
well; but I needn&#8217;t stop you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t mind that!&#8221; grinned the other. &#8220;We&#8217;re
not paid by the piece on this job. Besides, they&#8217;ve some
chisels for us on your train and we haven&#8217;t got them yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re English, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; Prescott asked. &#8220;Are
you stopping out here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much!&#8221; exclaimed the other with scorn. &#8220;What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
d&#8217;you take me for? There&#8217;s more in life than whacking
rivets and holding the caulker. When a man has
finished his work in this wilderness, what has he to do?
There&#8217;s no music halls, no nothing; only the dismal
prairie that makes your eyes sore to look at.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott had heard other Englishmen express themselves
in a similar fashion, and he laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s what you think of the country, why did
you come here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Big wages,&#8221; replied the first man, entering the
building. &#8220;Funny, isn&#8217;t it, that when you want good
work done you have to send for us? Every machine-shop
in your country&#8217;s full of labor-saving and ingenious
tools, but when you build bridges with them they fall
down, and I&#8217;ve seen tanks that wouldn&#8217;t hold water.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; said Prescott, divided between amusement
and impatience, &#8220;this isn&#8217;t to the point. I understand
Kermode was here with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was. Came in on a construction train, looking
for a job, and when we saw he was from the old country
we put him on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You put him on? Don&#8217;t these things rest with
the division boss?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man grinned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand. We&#8217;re specialists and get
what we ask for. Sent the boss word we wanted an
assistant, and, as we&#8217;d picked one up, all he had to do
was to put him on the pay-roll.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And did Kermode get through his work satisfactorily?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For a while. He was a handy man; might have
made a boiler-maker if he&#8217;d took to it young. When
we had nothing else to keep him busy, he&#8217;d cut tobacco
for us and set us laughing with his funny talk.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>This was much in keeping with Jernyngham&#8217;s character.
But the man went on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;When we&#8217;d made him a pretty good hand with
the file and drill, he got Bill to teach him how to caulk.
He shaped first-rate, so one day we thought we&#8217;d
leave him to it while we went off for a jaunt. Bill
had bought an old shot-gun from a farmer, and we&#8217;d
seen a lot of wild hens about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be close time&mdash;you can only shoot them
in October; but I suppose that wouldn&#8217;t count.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit,&#8221; said the boiler-maker. &#8220;All we were
afraid of was that a train might come in with the boss on
board; but we chanced it. We told Kermode he might
go round the tank-plate landings&mdash;the laps, you know&mdash;with
the caulker, and give them a rough tuck in, ready
for us to finish; and then we went off. Well, we didn&#8217;t
shoot any wild hens, though Bill got some pellets in his
leg, and when we came back we both felt pretty bad when
we saw what Kermode had done. Bill couldn&#8217;t think
of names enough to call him, and he&#8217;s good at it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What had he done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hammered the inside of the landings down with
a gullet you could put your finger in. Too much energy&#8217;s
your mate&#8217;s complaint. Nobody could tell what that
man would do when he gets steam up. Understand,
we&#8217;re boiler-making specialists, sent out on awkward
jobs; and he&#8217;d put in work that would disgrace a farmer!
For all that, it was Bill&#8217;s fault for speaking his mind too
free&mdash;he got thrown behind the tank.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; contradicted the other. &#8220;He jumped
at me unexpected when the spanner hit him, and I fell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott laughed. Remembering how Jernyngham
had driven a truculent rabble out of Sebastian, he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
imagine the scene in the shed; but it was evident that
the boiler-makers bore him no malice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; said the first one, &#8220;when we cooled off
and got talking quiet, he said he&#8217;d better go, and we
parted friendly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where he went?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t; we didn&#8217;t care. We&#8217;d had enough of him.
First thing was to put that caulking right, and we spent
three or four days driving the landings down&mdash;you can
do a lot with good soft steel. Anyhow, when we filled
up the time-sheet showing how far we&#8217;d got on with the
job, there was a nasty letter from the engineer. Wanted
to know what we&#8217;d been playing at and said he&#8217;d have
us sent home if we couldn&#8217;t do better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While Prescott thanked them for the information
a bell began to toll and there was a rattle of wheels.
Hurrying out, he saw a locomotive approaching the
tank and men clambering on to the cars in which he had
traveled. Soon after he joined them, the train rolled out
of the side-track and sped west, clattering and jolting
toward the lurid sunset that burned upon the edge of the
plain. Jack-pines and scattered birches stood out hard
and black against the glare, the rails blazed with crimson
fire and faded as the ruddy light changed to cold green,
and there was a sting of frost in the breeze.
</p>
<p>They dropped a few men at places where work was
going on, stopped for water, and crawled at slow speed
over half-finished bridges and lengths of roughly graded
line. After nightfall it grew bitterly cold and Prescott,
lying on the boards with his blanket over him, shivered,
half asleep. For the most part, darkness shut them in,
but every now and then lights blazed beside the line and
voices hailed the engineer as the pace decreased. Then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
while the whistle shrieked, ballast cars on a side-track
and tall iron frameworks slipped by, and they ran out
again into the silent waste. Prescott was conscious of
a continuous jolting which shook him to and fro; he
thought he heard a confused altercation among his
companions at the end of the car, and the clang of
wheels and the shaking rails rang in measured cadence
in his ears. Then the sounds died away and he fell into
a heavy sleep.
</p>
<p>It was noon the next day when he alighted, aching all
over, where the line ran into a deep hollow between fir-clad
hills. A stream came flashing through the gorge
and at the mouth of it shacks and tents and small frame
houses straggled up a rise, with a wooden church behind
them. Farther up, the hollow was filled with somber
conifers, and the hills above it ran back, ridge beyond
ridge, into the distance. Then, looking very high and
far away, a vast chain of snowy summits was etched
against a sky of softest blue. Those that caught the
light gleamed with silvery brightness, but part of the
great range lay in shadow, steeped in varying hues of
ethereal gray. From north to south, as far as the eye
could follow, the serrated line of crag and peak swept on
majestically.
</p>
<p>Tired as he was, Prescott felt the impressiveness
of the spectacle; but he had other things to think about,
and slipping away from the railroad hands, he turned
toward a rude frame hotel which stood among the firs
beside the river. Rows of tall stumps spread about it,
farther back lay rows of logs, diffusing a sweet resinous
fragrance. Through a gap between the towering trunks
one looked up the wild, forest-shrouded gorge, and the
litter of old provision cans, general refuse, and discarded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
boots could not spoil the beauty of the scene. Prescott
asked for a room; and sitting outside after dinner, he
gathered from some men, who were not working, the
story of Kermode&#8217;s next exploit. Their accounts of it
were terse and somewhat disconnected, but Prescott
was afterward able to amplify them from the narrative
of a more cultured person.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Kermode had been unloading rails all day, and he
was standing on the veranda one evening when a supply
train from the east was due. It appeared that he had
renewed his wardrobe at the local store and invariably
changed his clothes when his work was finished. This
was looked upon as a very unusual thing, and his companions
thought it even more curious that he had not been
known to enter the bar of the hotel; its proprietor was
emphatic on the point. A number of railroad hands
lounged about, attired as usual in their working clothes.
</p>
<p>At length the tolling of a bell broke through the
silence of the woods and the train ran in. The rutted
street became crowded with unkempt, thirsty men, and
in a few minutes the hotel was filled with their harsh
voices. Last of all appeared a girl, with a very untidy
man carrying a bag beside her. She walked with a
limp, and looked jaded and rather frightened. Her
light cloak was thick with dust and locomotive cinders
which clung to the woolly material; her face was hot and
anxious, but attractive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said to her companion, opening her
purse when they reached the veranda.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! You can put that back,&#8221; returned the man
with an awkward gesture and then, lifting the bag,
carefully replaced the end of a garment that projected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
through the bottom. &#8220;I&#8217;ll carry the grip in for you, but
you want to be careful with the thing. Seems to have
got busted when the rails fell on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl passed through a wire-net door that he opened,
and Kermode, following, waited for several minutes after
her companion had rung a bell. Then a man in a white
shirt and smart clothes appeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I send a telegram from here to Drummond?&#8221;
she asked him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; the wires won&#8217;t run into that district until next
year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I get there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll have to hire a team at the livery-stable;
take you about three days to get through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl looked dismayed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then can you give me a room to-night?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;we&#8217;re full up with the railroad
boys; the waitresses have to camp in the kitchen. Don&#8217;t
know if anybody can take you in; the track bosses have
got all the rooms in town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He disappeared and the girl sat down, looking very
forlorn and disconsolate. Her voice was English and
she had obviously traveled a long distance in an open car
on the supply train. Kermode felt sorry for her. He
took off his hat as he approached.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind waiting a few minutes, I&#8217;ll see if
I can find you quarters,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>She glanced at him suspiciously, with a heightened
color, which he thought a favorable sign, but her eyes
grew more confident and when she agreed he withdrew.
As a man of experience who had been a favorite with
women, he was, however, guilty of an error of judgment
during his search. A smart young woman with whom he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
was on friendly terms managed a cigar store, and it is
possible that she would have taken some trouble to oblige
him; but his request that she should offer shelter to another
girl whose acquaintance he seemed to have made in
a most casual manner was received with marked coldness.
Kermode, indeed, felt sorry he had suggested it when he
left the store and set out for a shack belonging to the
widow of a man killed on the line. She was elderly and
grim, a strict Methodist from the east, who earned a
pittance by mending the workmen&#8217;s clothes. After
catechizing Kermode severely, she gave a very qualified
assent; and returning to the hotel, he found the girl
anxiously waiting for him. She looked relieved when he
reported his success.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had better go at once,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You think Mrs.
Jasper will take me in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kermode picked up the bag.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell the truth, she only promised to have a look at
you.&#8221; Then he smiled reassuringly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt
there&#8217;ll be no difficulty when she has done so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl followed him and, as they went slowly up the
street, while all the loungers watched them, she gave
Kermode a confused explanation. Her name was Helen
Foster, and she had come from England to join a brother
who had taken up a farm near Drummond, which Prescott
had heard was a remote settlement. Her brother
had told her to notify him on her arrival at Winnipeg and
await instructions, but on board the steamer she had met
the wife of a railroad man engaged on the new line who
had offered her company to a point in the west from which
Helen could reach her destination. On arriving at the
railroad man&#8217;s station, he had sent her on by the supply
train.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>A little distance up the street, Kermode stopped outside
a shed in which a fellow of unprepossessing appearance
was rubbing down a horse. His character, as Kermode
knew, was no better than his looks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must see the liveryman,&#8221; he told the girl, and when
he had sent the hostler for him the proprietor came out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The round-trip to Drummond will take six days, and
you&#8217;d want a team,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;d have to charge you
thirty dollars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kermode looked dubious, his companion dismayed.
She had three dollars and a few cents.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you drive this lady there?&#8221; Kermode asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. Jim would have to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; said Kermode firmly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you
about a saddle-horse in the morning.&#8221; He turned to
the girl: &#8220;We&#8217;ll go along again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A few minutes later they reached the widow&#8217;s shack
and Kermode waited some time after his companion
was admitted. As she did not come out, he concluded
that Mrs. Jasper was satisfied and returned to the hotel,
where he was freely bantered by the loungers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do, boys,&#8221; he said at length. &#8220;If there&#8217;s
any more of this kind of talk, the man who keeps it up
will get badly hurt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They saw that he meant it and, as he was popular,
they left him in peace.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>MISS FOSTER&#8217;S ESCORT</h3>
</div>

<p>On the morning after he met Helen Foster, Kermode
sought a foreman with whom he was on good terms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to quit work for a week,&#8221; he said abruptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry; I can&#8217;t give you leave, and the boss went
down the line yesterday. If you let up before you see
him, it&#8217;s quite likely he won&#8217;t take you back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t I won&#8217;t be very grieved. Throwing
forty-foot rails about all day palls on one. But
what about my wages up to date?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a matter for the pay-clerk when he comes
along. If you quit without notice, he&#8217;ll make trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kermode considered this; but he had about ten
dollars in his pocket and he was not of provident nature.
He decided that something must be left to chance,
though the thought that he might have handled heavy
rails for the contractor&#8217;s exclusive benefit was strongly
distasteful. Walking across the town, he paid a visit to
Miss Foster.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you ride?&#8221; he asked her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t ridden for years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you could manage a steady horse which
wouldn&#8217;t go faster than a walk?&#8221; he suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then she hesitated. &#8220;But horses are expensive,
and I have very little money left. Somehow, it
seems to disappear rapidly in Canada.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an annoying trick it has,&#8221; Kermode laughed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
&#8220;However, you had better start for Drummond this
morning, and I&#8217;ll go with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl looked dubious. She knew nothing about
him, but his manner and appearance were in his favor,
and her position was far from pleasant. Mrs. Jasper,
who had already presented what appeared to be an extortionate
bill, seemed by no means anxious to keep her,
and it might be a long time before she could communicate
with her brother. How she was to hold out until he came
to her assistance she could not tell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said, gathering her courage; and
after promising that he would be back in an hour,
Kermode went away.
</p>
<p>He was a man who acted on impulse and, as a rule,
the more unusual a course was the better it pleased him.
In spite of her lameness Miss Foster was attractive, which,
perhaps, had its effect, though he was mainly actuated
by compassion and the monotony of his track-laying task.
He did not think the settlement, in which there were very
few women, was the kind of place in which she could
comfortably remain, particularly if her means were exhausted.
Presently he met the livery-stable keeper
driving in his buggy and motioned to him to pull up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much will you charge for the hire of the roan, to
go to Drummond?&#8221; he asked, and the man named his
charge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you eight dollars now and the balance when
I come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No sir!&#8221; replied the other firmly. &#8220;You might fix
up to stay there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will an order on the railroad pay-clerk satisfy you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t. If you want the horse, you must put the
money down.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then I can&#8217;t make the deal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man drove on, but Kermode was not to be daunted
by such a difficulty; besides, he had noticed Jim, the
hired man, dawdling about the outside of the stable.
When the buggy was out of sight, he accosted him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want the roan in half an hour,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I see
you have Mrs. Leaver&#8217;s saddle here, and as she&#8217;s away,
you had better put it on. I&#8217;m going to take the lady
you saw with me to Drummond.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;S&#8217;pose you have seen the boss about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have noticed me talking to him,&#8221; Kermode
replied curtly. &#8220;Bring the horse along to Mrs. Jasper&#8217;s
as soon as you&#8217;re ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he returned to the hotel and wrote a note which
he gave the bar-tender, instructing him to let the proprietor
of the livery-stable have it when he came in for
dinner. After this he succeeded in borrowing a small
tent, and when he had supplied himself with provisions
he hurried toward the widow&#8217;s shack. The horse was
already there, and when he had strapped on the folded
tent and Miss Foster&#8217;s bag he helped her to mount, and
set off, carrying his blankets and stores in a pack on his
back. He showed no sign of haste and chatted gaily,
though he was anxious to get out of the town as soon as
possible, because he did not know when the stable-keeper
would return.
</p>
<p>It was a clear morning; the girl looked brighter after
her night&#8217;s rest, and the fresh air brought a fine color
into her face. Kermode kept her laughing with his
light chatter, but he was nevertheless glad when they
reached the shadow of the pines, where they could travel
faster without attracting attention. After half an hour&#8217;s
rapid walking, he left the trail, which ran on toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
Drummond for a day&#8217;s journey before it stopped at
a ranch, and turned down into the valley. He thought
it might be wiser to keep to the south of the line he would
be expected to take, though this would entail the crossing
of rougher country. Reaching the edge of a stream, he
stopped and regarded it with some concern. It ran fast
between great boulders and looked deep, but as there was
no sign of a better crossing he warned the girl to hold on,
and led the horse in.
</p>
<p>After a few paces he sank above his knees, and found
it hard to keep his footing and the horse&#8217;s head upstream.
The roan was slipping badly among the stones and the
hem of his companion&#8217;s skirt was getting wet. He was
pleased to notice that she did not look unduly alarmed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be across in another minute or two,&#8221; he
said as cheerfully as he could.
</p>
<p>She smiled at him rather dubiously and at the next
step he sank deeper and dragged the horse round as he
clung to the bridle. The roan plunged savagely and
the water rippled about Kermode&#8217;s waist as he struggled
for a foothold on the slippery stones. With a desperate
effort he managed to find firmer bottom and soon came
out on a strip of shingle. Stopping there for a few
moments, he gathered breath while the girl looked about.
They were in the bottom of a deep gorge filled with the
sound of running water and sweet resinous scents.
Here the torrent flashed in bright sunshine; there it
flowed, streaked with foam, through dim shadow, while
somber pines towered above it. There was no sound or
sign of human life; they had entered the gates of the
wilderness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do we go next?&#8221; the girl asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Up this slope,&#8221; said Kermode. &#8220;Then among the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
pines, across the hills, and high plains, into a lonely
land. I don&#8217;t suppose we&#8217;ll see a house until we get to
Drummond.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know the way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Kermode said cheerfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never
been here before, but I&#8217;m accustomed to traveling about
the prairie, where trails are scarce. You don&#8217;t look
daunted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a hint of pleasurable excitement in his
companion&#8217;s laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;adventures appeal to me, and I&#8217;ve
never met with any. For three years since my brother
left, I&#8217;ve led a life of drudgery; and before that, half the
pleasures I might have had were denied me by an
accident.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Recognizing a kindred nature, Kermode looked sympathetic.
She was evidently alluding to her lameness,
which must prove a heavy handicap to a girl of the
active, sanguine temperament he thought she possessed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way, it was a great adventure for you to come
out here alone over the new road,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so last night,&#8221; she confessed with a smile.
&#8220;When I reached the settlement and found I could get
no farther, I was really scared. Now, however, all my
fears have gone. I suppose it&#8217;s the sunshine and this
glorious air.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we had better get on. I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have
to walk a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She let him lift her down, with no sign of prudishness
or coquetry, and he led the horse uphill while she followed.
Her attitude pleased him, because he had no
desire for philandering, although he was content to act
as protector and guide. Still, while he adapted his pace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
to the girl&#8217;s he thought about her. Her rather shabby
attire and scanty baggage hinted that she had not been
used to affluence; but she showed signs of possessing a
vigorous, well-trained mind, and he decided that she
must have been a teacher.
</p>
<p>When they reached the top of the ascent, she mounted
and they went on among scattered clumps of pines and
across a tableland as fast as he could travel, because it
seemed prudent to place as long a distance as possible
between them and the settlement. He had left the
place with a valuable horse and saddle which he had not
paid for, and he was very dubious whether the livery-stable
keeper would be satisfied with the promises he
had left. Accordingly he only stopped for half an hour
at noon; and evening was near when he helped the girl
down and picketed the horse beside a small birch bluff,
and set up the tent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are provisions in my pack and you might
lay out supper, but I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll make a fire to-night,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back in about half an hour;
I want to see what lies beyond the top of yonder ridge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She let him go, and he climbed between slender
birches to the summit of a long rise, where he lay down
and lighted his pipe. From his lofty position he commanded
a wide sweep of country&mdash;hills whose higher
slopes were still bathed in warm light, valleys filled with
cool blue shadow, straggling ranks of somber pines. The
air was sharp and wonderfully bracing; the wilderness,
across which he could wander where he would, lured
him on. Irresponsible and impatient of restraint, as he
was, he delighted in the openness and solitude. For all
that, he concentrated his gaze on one particular strip of
bare hillside. At its foot ran the gorge they had crossed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
but it had now grown narrow and precipitous, a deep
chasm wrapped in shadow. He did not think a horse
could be led down into it, which was consoling, because
if any pursuit had been attempted, it would follow the
opposite side, near which a trail ran.
</p>
<p>After a while his vigilance was rewarded, and he
smiled when three very small figures of mounted men
appeared on the hillslope. They were going back
disappointed, and he did not think he had much to
fear from them. Wages were high about the settlement,
where everybody was busy, and the liveryman would, no
doubt, find the search too costly to persist in. When the
horsemen had vanished, he returned to the camp, and
Miss Foster glanced at him keenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Supper&#8217;s quite ready; you have been some time,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;What did you see from the top?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mountains, woods and valleys. They were well
worth looking at in the sunset light.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what else? As you live in this country, you
didn&#8217;t go up for the view.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kermode saw that she was suspicious, and thought
her too intelligent to be put off with an excuse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit that I wasn&#8217;t greatly surprised to see three
men a long way off. They were riding back to the
settlement and I dare say they were angry as well as
tired.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she said. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t light a fire, though
you have a package of tea here and there&#8217;s a spring near-by.
You thought it wouldn&#8217;t be prudent?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did think something of the kind; but won&#8217;t you
begin your supper? What shall I hand you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a little. You haven&#8217;t told me very much
yet.&#8221; Then her eyes sparkled with amusement. &#8220;Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
Kermode, I&#8217;d better say that my brother will be responsible
for the expenses of this journey. I suppose you
haven&#8217;t paid for the horse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunately true. The trouble was that your
brother lives a long way off, and you led me to believe
that your money was running out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; she said calmly, &#8220;fifty cents left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kermode began on a sandwich she handed him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve three or four dollars. You see our difficulty
needed a drastic remedy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you were at work on the railroad. I understand
wages are high.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so; but it&#8217;s some time since the pay car came
along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will get what is due you, when you go back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have another sandwich,&#8221; said Kermode. &#8220;You
have made them very well.&#8221; Then seeing that she meant
to have an answer, he added: &#8220;I&#8217;m not going back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A little color crept into her face as she looked at him.
Kermode had for a time led a dissipated life, but there
had been a change during the last few months. He had
practised abstinence, and in new surroundings found it
easier than he had expected; severe labor had healed and
hardened him. His brown skin was clear, his pale-blue
eyes were bright and steady, his figure was spare and
finely lined.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you sacrificed your wages to assist a
stranger?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He made her a whimsical bow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to think we&#8217;ll be better acquainted before we
part.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what will you do now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he responded lightly, &#8220;that&#8217;s hardly worth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
talking about. I&#8217;ll strike something. So long as you&#8217;re
pretty active there&#8217;s generally work to be had, and when
it grows monotonous you pull out and go on again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Foster mused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; she said, &#8220;life must have a good deal to
offer a strong man with the ability to make the most of
things. He can set off, when he likes, in search of new
and interesting experiences.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has its drawbacks now and then,&#8221; declared Kermode,
smiling. &#8220;Anyway, you needn&#8217;t imagine you&#8217;re
shut off from everything of the kind. You took a big
risk and faced a startling change when you came out here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I felt. Though I had misgivings, the thought of
it drew me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. You have courage, the greatest gift,
and you felt circumscribed at home. No doubt, the love
of adventure isn&#8217;t confined to one sex. It&#8217;s a longing many
of us can&#8217;t overcome; but it doesn&#8217;t seem to meet with
general sympathy, and it&#8217;s apt to get one into difficulties.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Miss Foster assented with some bitterness;
&#8220;particularly a woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After that, she went on with her meal while dusk
crept up about the lonely camp. The sky was pale green
in the west and the hills stood out against it, black and
calm; not a breath of wind was stirring and it was very
still, except that out of the distance came the murmur of
falling water. When the air grew damper, Kermode
brought her a blanket which she wrapped about her
shoulders and they talked on for an hour in a casual
manner. Then he got up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be quite safe in the tent,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
found a comfortable berth in the wood. We&#8217;ll get off
as soon as it&#8217;s light to-morrow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>He disappeared into the shadows and she noticed that
he had left her the two blankets he had brought from the
settlement. She hesitated about taking them both, but
decided not to call him back. A little later she entered
the tent, while Kermode scraped out a hollow in a bank
of fallen leaves and went to sleep.
</p>
<p>The grass was white with frost when Miss Foster left
the tent in the morning, but a fire of branches crackled
cheerfully near-by and Kermode was busy with a frying-pan.
A light cloud of smoke rose into the still, cold air,
and day was breaking on the eastern horizon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This looks pretty good,&#8221; he said, taking out a greasy
cake and several strips of pork. &#8220;If you will make the
tea, I&#8217;ll water the horse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was back in a few minutes. His companion
enjoyed the simple meal, and when it was finished they
resumed the march. During most of the day their
pathway led over high, treeless ridges which lay in bright
sunshine, though a delicate haze dimmed the encircling
hills. Then they dipped to a valley where they had
trouble among the timber and the girl was forced to dismount.
The winter gales had swept the forest and great
pines lay piled in belts of tangled ruin, through which
Kermode found it difficult to lead the horse, while as they
floundered over branches and through crackling brush
his companion&#8217;s limp grew more pronounced. Afterward
there were several rapid creeks to be forded, and
Kermode was wet and Miss Foster very tired when they
camped at sunset, in a grove of spruce. Little was
said during the evening meal and soon after it was over
the girl sought her tent, while Kermode found a resting-place
among the withered sprays at the foot of a tree.
</p>
<p>They spent the next morning toiling up a long ascent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
and from its summit a prospect of majestic beauty burst
upon them. The great peaks had grown nearer, the air
was clear, and the girl sat, rapt, in the saddle, gazing at
the vast snow-fields that glittered with ethereal brilliance,
very high up against a cloudless sky. Then the wonderful
blue coloring of the shadows streaking the white
slopes caught her glance, and she found it unutterably
lovely. Kermode, however, had an eye for other things
and carefully searched the wide valley that stretched
away beneath them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you looking for?&#8221; the girl asked at length.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Smoke; I thought I saw a faint streak, but it has gone.
I suppose you didn&#8217;t notice it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no!&#8221; she told him with a smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
I shouldn&#8217;t have noticed such a commonplace thing,
even if it had been very plain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He made a sign of comprehension.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what have you seen?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Unapproachable, stainless whiteness, touched with
an unearthly glory that daunts the mind!&#8221; Then her
expression changed. &#8220;But the sight is too overpowering
to talk about. I would have been more useful had I
looked for smoke, as that would mean a house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kermode nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have stores enough for another meal or two and
had better get on. I believe I&#8217;ve kept pretty near the line
I was told to take, but I&#8217;d be glad to see the first ranch in
the Drummond district by supper time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went down into the valley, struggling through
belts of timber and clumps of brush, until they reached
a broad expanse of grass broken by small bluffs. After
camping for a meal, they pushed on steadily while the
girl grappled with a growing fatigue, until the white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
peaks faded into dusky blue and the waste grew shadowy.
Kermode had seen no sign of life and he was getting
anxious when, as they approached a bluff, he pulled up
the horse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I think I heard something!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment or two, and then he
caught a soft drumming and a rattle that might have
been made by wheels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a team and wagon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sound grew plainer, and when Kermode shouted,
an answer came out of the gathering darkness. Then a
moving shape appeared from behind the bluff, and a
minute or two later the newcomer pulled up his team.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what do you want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom!&#8221; cried the girl excitedly.
</p>
<p>The man sprang down, and Kermode needed no explanation.
After his companion had dismounted and
run forward, he stood quietly holding the horse, until she
beckoned him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Kermode, who brought me here,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;My brother, Tom Foster.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indebted to you,&#8221; responded the man. &#8220;I was
driving home when you shouted; my place is about
six miles off. If you&#8217;ll follow, I&#8217;ll take my sister in the
wagon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kermode thought it better that she should explain the
reason for their journey, and he got into the saddle and
contented himself with keeping the vehicle in sight until
it stopped at a wooden house that stood near a sod stable
and rude log barn. When he entered the dwelling after
putting up the horse, the lamp was lighted and the
stove burning. He saw that Foster was a young man
with a good-humored brown face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that I owe you more than I thought at
first,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Helen seems to have been pretty awkwardly
situated when you appeared on the scene. Sit
down and smoke while I get supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They talked gaily during the meal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any means of sending back the horse I
brought?&#8221; Kermode asked after a while.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking about that,&#8221; Foster replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a neighbor who is going east on business.
He&#8217;ll strike the new line where you left it, and he&#8217;ll be
glad to have the horse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then they talked about other matters, but when the
men sat smoking some time later, Foster said cordially:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll stay here a while?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kermode said that he would remain a few days.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where will you make for then?&#8221; his host asked.
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing doing round here except a little cattle-raising.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For the mountains, I think. I hear the railroad
people are busy in the passes; but I&#8217;ll try to strike something
softer than handling rails.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can fix that,&#8221; Foster declared. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been
advertising for haulage tenders&mdash;there are a lot of
piles and building logs they want brought in. Now
I&#8217;ve two good horses I&#8217;ve not much use for and I&#8217;d
be glad to let you have them. You could bring them
back when the frost stops work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Kermode. &#8220;What&#8217;s your idea of
shares?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rancher declared that he did not expect a share,
but when Kermode insisted, they arrived at a satisfactory
understanding, and soon after Helen appeared
the party broke up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>Kermode spent three or four pleasant days with his
new friends, and when he left the ranch one morning,
leading two strong horses, Helen Foster walked with
him some distance up the valley. She had not known
him long enough to recognize his failings, which were
plentiful, but his virtues were obvious, and she knew
that she would miss him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are going out on the trail again,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Where will it lead you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he answered with a gay laugh, &#8220;is more than
I can tell. No doubt, to fresh adventures and strange
experiences.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you know your first stopping-place, the railroad
camp. When you have finished your work there, you
could come here again and rest a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, more gravely; &#8220;I&#8217;ll send your brother
his horses, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll come back. It&#8217;s nice
to feel that we have been pretty good friends, but it might
spoil any pleasant impression I&#8217;m leaving if you saw too
much of me. Besides, I&#8217;m a wanderer; the long trail
beckons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It runs through swamps and many rough places
into the lonely wilds. Aren&#8217;t you afraid of weariness?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kermode smiled, falling into her mood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may remember that there are compensations,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;glimpses of glory on the untrodden heights.
It&#8217;s true that one never gets there, but they lead
one on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can see them from the valley.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; the farmer&#8217;s eyes are fixed on the furrow; he
must follow the plow. His crop and his stock are
nearer him; he cannot see past them. The wanderer&#8217;s
mind is free.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When you had that glimpse of glory, you turned
away and looked for household smoke.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There you have me,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Inconsistent,
wasn&#8217;t it? But we&#8217;re only human: one needs rest and
food.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Helen changed the subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;I&#8217;m grateful; and if it&#8217;s any
comfort, you won&#8217;t be forgotten.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped the restive horses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good to hear,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;But the ground
is rough ahead and you have come some way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; she said, and gave him her hand.
</p>
<p>He held it for a moment, and then, getting into the
saddle, turned and swung off his hat. After that he
rode on into the waste, leading one horse; and Helen
Foster watched him for a while before she went back,
slowly and thoughtfully, to the ranch.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE MISSIONARY&#8217;S ALLY</h3>
</div>

<p>On reaching the railroad camp, Kermode was engaged
by the contractor to haul in logs cut in a neighboring
forest for constructional purposes. The line ran into a
wild valley, clinging to the rocks that formed one side of
it, with a torrent brawling hoarsely among the stones
beneath. Above rose vast slopes, streaked in some
places with small firs, in others ground to a smooth scarp
by sliding snow. Farther back were glaciers and a
chain of glittering peaks.
</p>
<p>The mouth of the valley had been laid out as the site
of a future town, but so far it was occupied by rows of
tents and rude wooden shacks, inhabited by the construction
gangs. A large proportion of them were
orderly, well-conducted men: industrious immigrants
who had seized the first opportunity for getting work,
small farmers attracted by high wages, skilled artisans.
There were, however, some of a rougher type; and the
undesirable element, was, as usual, well represented.
On the whole, the camp was sober, largely because no
licenses had been issued, though this did not prevent men
who came up from other points from bringing liquor in,
and the authorities suspected another source of supply.
</p>
<p>Kermode had little trouble with his work, which he
found profitable, and he rapidly made friends. Among
them was a young Presbyterian missionary whom he
met for the first time on the hillside, engaged on a squared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
log with a big jack-plane. He wore knee-boots and a
threadbare suit of gray, while his hat had suffered from
exposure to the weather. Kermode stopped his team
near-by and the clergyman looked around.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have a good eye, you might tell me whether
this chamfer&#8217;s running true,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You want a bit off here.&#8221; Kermode laid his finger
on the spot. &#8220;Except for that, it&#8217;s good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The clergyman sat down and pulled out a tobacco
pouch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to it presently, but I feel I&#8217;m entitled to a
rest. Take a smoke; you&#8217;re not paid on time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure it would matter if I were.&#8221; Kermode&#8217;s
eyes twinkled as he filled his pipe. &#8220;An idea of the kind
you suggested doesn&#8217;t go far in a construction camp, unless,
of course, a foreman happens to be about. However,
you made one rash statement, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I make a good many,&#8221; replied the clergyman
good-humoredly. &#8220;But you are right. It would
be very rash to claim all that one was entitled to; in
other words, one&#8217;s deserts. You&#8217;re Mr. Kermode, I
believe; you must know my name is Ferguson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kermode bowed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with this log?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s to be a door-post in the new church. I wonder
if you would be willing to haul it in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kermode said that he would be glad to do so.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You encourage me to go a little farther,&#8221; Ferguson
continued. &#8220;Building a church is a costly proposition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I should imagine; I can&#8217;t speak from experience.&#8221;
Kermode was generally liberal, and he took out some
money. &#8220;I think you ought to let me off with this, as I
don&#8217;t belong to your flock.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a generous contribution; better than the excuse.
There are, I may remind you, many kinds of sheep, and
the outward difference is often marked. Since, you&#8217;re
from the old country, you can take the little Cheviot and
the ponderous Shropshire as examples. You see the
drift of this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That they&#8217;re all sheep. I&#8217;ve noticed, however, that
they wear a good many different brands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, the pity of it! After all, a shepherd has his
human weaknesses; perhaps he&#8217;s too fond of using his
private mark or the stamp of his guild.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; Kermode smiled, &#8220;is a handsome admission.
Anyway, you have no rival in shepherding the boys here;
and taking us all round, we need it. But can you raise
building funds on the spot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! I went to Ontario this summer and spent
a month begging from people who have very little to
spare. The response was generous&mdash;I&#8217;ve a carload of
shiplap lumber coming out; but you may understand
how that adds to one&#8217;s responsibility.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s obvious. I suppose you know you&#8217;re up against a
strong opposition?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, unfortunately.&#8221; The clergyman looked
thoughtful. &#8220;There&#8217;s one group, the Mitcham crowd,
who would like to run me out. The fellow&#8217;s piling up
money by smuggling in liquor; he and his friends are
depraving the camp. They must be stopped.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big thing for one man to undertake. It may
wreck your mission.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ferguson&#8217;s eyes sparkled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The risk mustn&#8217;t count. One can&#8217;t shut one&#8217;s eyes
to what those fellows are doing. But I want backers;
will you give me your support?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s more than I can consistently promise. However,
I&#8217;ll look on and see you get fair play. If the opposition
hit below the belt, I may take a hand in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; responded Ferguson, and Kermode went
on with his team.
</p>
<p>He was favorably impressed by the young missionary
and kept the promise he had made, though it now and
then involved him in difficulties with his comrades. The
carload of lumber duly arrived, and with the help of
men who gave their labor after their hard day&#8217;s work
was done, the church was raised by the light of flaring
blast-lamps which the contractor allowed. By day,
Ferguson worked at it alone, and the building steadily
grew into shape; but as the weather got colder trouble
broke out in camp. Men engaged on the higher portions
of the line were laid off by snow and frost, and when the
cost of their board ran on, their tempers got short. There
were dismissals, and as working hours diminished, the
gangs were driven harder. Friends began to quarrel
over games of chance, and the violence they displayed
was often accounted for by indulgence in smuggled
liquor.
</p>
<p>Ferguson, however, was making progress: gaining
staunch adherents here, tacit sympathizers there, though
the opposition saw to it that several had reason to regret
their joining him. Kermode took no open part in the
struggle, but watched it interestedly.
</p>
<p>At length, one nipping morning, he left his tent with
a shiver before it was light and busied himself about his
horses with a lantern in their rude branch and bark
shelter. Winter was beginning in earnest, and a bitter
wind had raged all night, covering gorge and hillside
deep with snow, but this would make his hauling easier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
when he had broken out a trail. He plowed through the
snow in the darkness, and the threatening dawn had
broken when he came down the hillside with the ends of
three or four big logs trailing behind his jumper-sled.
The shacks and tents were white in the hollow, over which
there floated a haze of thin, blue smoke; the rapid creek
that flowed past them showed in leaden-colored streaks
among the ice; and somber pines rose in harsh distinctness
from the hillside.
</p>
<p>Then the half-covered frame of the church caught
Kermode&#8217;s eye. Something was wrong with it. The
skeleton tower looked out of the perpendicular; and on
his second glance its inclination seemed to have increased.
The snow, however, was clogging the front of his sled
and he set to work to scrape it off. While he was thus
engaged there was a sharp, ripping sound, and then a
heavy crash, and swinging around he saw that the tower
had collapsed. Where it had stood lay a pile of broken
timber, and planks and beams were strewn about the
snow.
</p>
<p>Kermode urged his team downhill, and when a group
of men came running up to meet him, he recognized
Ferguson some distance in front of them. The man&#8217;s
face showed how heavy the blow had been.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks bad; I&#8217;m very sorry,&#8221; said Kermode when
they reached the wrecked building.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we can&#8217;t get things straight until spring
and I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;ll raise the money then,&#8221; declared
Ferguson. &#8220;A good deal of the lumber seems destroyed,
and I&#8217;ve levied pretty heavily on every friend I&#8217;ve got.&#8221;
Then he tried to assume a philosophic tone. &#8220;Well, I
suppose this is the result of impatience; there were spikes
I didn&#8217;t put in because I couldn&#8217;t wait for them and some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
tenons were badly cut. It blew hard last night and there
must have been a big weight of snow on the new
shingling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re right,&#8221; Kermode said dryly,
and turned to a bridge-carpenter who stood near-by.
&#8220;What&#8217;s your idea?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The thrust of what roof they&#8217;d got up wouldn&#8217;t come
on the beams that gave,&#8221; rejoined the man. &#8220;There&#8217;s
something here I don&#8217;t catch on to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said Kermode. &#8220;Suppose you take a look
at the king-posts and stringers. We&#8217;ll clear this fallen
lumber out of the way, boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They set to work, and in an hour the sound and
damaged timber had been sorted into piles. Then, when
the foundations were exposed, Kermode and the carpenter
examined a socket in which a broken piece of wood
remained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been a blamed bad tenon,&#8221; the mechanic
remarked. &#8220;The shoulders weren&#8217;t butted home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s true; I made it,&#8221; Ferguson admitted;
but Kermode, laying his finger on the rent wood, looked
up at his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For all that, should it have given way as it has done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you better when we find the beam it belonged
to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It took them some time; and then the carpenter turned
to Ferguson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You marked this tenon off before you cut it. Did
you run the saw past your line?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Ferguson with a start; &#8220;that&#8217;s certain. I
dressed up to the mark afterward with a chisel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The carpenter looked at Kermode meaningly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re right. See here&#8221;&mdash;he indicated the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
broken stump&mdash;&#8220;there&#8217;s a saw-cut running well inside
his mark. Now that tenon was a bit too small, anyway,
and when they&#8217;d notched her, she hadn&#8217;t wood enough
left to hold up the weight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were exclamations from the others standing
round in the snow, but Kermode glanced at Ferguson.
His face grew darkly red, but with an effort he controlled
his anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who can have done this thing?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no direct evidence to show, but I&#8217;ve my
suspicions,&#8221; Kermode said. &#8220;It&#8217;s dangerous to interfere
with people&#8217;s business, particularly when it isn&#8217;t quite
legitimate. You must have known you ran a risk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I should have let that stop me?&#8221;
Ferguson asked with sparkling eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a matter of opinion,&#8221; Kermode rejoined.
&#8220;Perhaps you had better wait and think the thing over
when you cool off. I&#8217;ve some logs to haul in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He moved off with his team and went on with his work
all day, but when night came he attended, by special invitation,
a meeting held in a tent that flapped and strained
in the boisterous wind. Half a dozen men were present,
steady and rather grim toilers with saw and shovel, and
though two or three had been born in Ontario, all were
of Scottish extraction. Their hard faces wore a singularly
resolute expression when Kermode entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;before we begin I&#8217;d better mention
that taking a part in a church assembly is a new thing to
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One or two of them frowned at this: his levity was not
in keeping with the occasion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re here, and we&#8217;ll listen to your opinion, if ye hae
one,&#8221; said their leader. &#8220;Jock is for raiding Mitcham&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
shack and firing him and the other scoundrel out
of camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see objections. Mitcham has a good many friends,
and if he held you off, you&#8217;d have made a row for nothing,
besides compromising Mr. Ferguson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s reason in that,&#8221; another remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; continued Kermode, &#8220;you can&#8217;t connect
Mitcham with the wrecking of your church.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking the connection&#8217;s plain enough for us.
Weel, we ken&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowing a thing is not sufficient; you want proof,
and if you go ahead without it, you&#8217;ll put yourselves in
the wrong. This is not the time to alienate popular
sympathy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel,&#8221; said the leader, &#8220;hae ye a plan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kermode lighted his pipe and after a few moments
answered thoughtfully:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear that Mitcham, Long Bill, and Libby will take
the trail to-morrow with Bill&#8217;s team and sled&mdash;he&#8217;s laid
off work because of the snow. They were away three or
four days once or twice before, and when they came back
a number of the boys got on a high-class jag and there
was trouble in camp. I dare say you can put the things
together?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; declared one who had not spoken yet. &#8220;Where
do we butt in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my suggestion&mdash;half a dozen picked men will
meet Mitcham coming home and seize the sled. If its
load is what I suspect, somebody will ride off for Sergeant
Inglis on my horse, and you&#8217;ll have a guard ready to
bring the sled to camp and hold the liquor until the police
arrive. I&#8217;m inclined to think you can leave the rest to
them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>A harsh smile crept into the faces of the listeners, and
their leader nodded gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot do better. It will work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The plan was duly put into execution, and one bitter
night Kermode and several others plodded up a frozen
creek. It had been snowing hard for the last few hours
and he could scarcely see his companions through the
driving flakes, while the wail of the wind in the pines
above drowned the soft sound of their footsteps. Kermode
was tired and very cold, and could not have explained
clearly what had induced him to accompany the
expedition. Adventure, however, always appealed to
him, and he was sorry for Ferguson, who had, he thought,
been very shabbily treated. Kermode had a fellow-feeling
for anybody in difficulties.
</p>
<p>After a while the snow ceased and they could dimly see
the dark pines climbing the steep banks that shut them
in. It was obvious that if Mitcham&#8217;s party had entered
the deep hollow, they could not well get out of it. The
expedition had only to go on or wait until it met them;
but Kermode did not envy the man whose duty it would
be to ride across the open waste to the lonely post where
Sergeant Inglis might be found. Resting, however, was
out of the question. They must move to keep from freezing,
and though the snow began again, they plodded on,
with heads lowered to meet the blast that drove the stinging
flakes into their faces.
</p>
<p>At length the leader stopped and raised his hand.
Standing still, they heard a muffled sound that might
have been made by the fall of hoofs ahead, and they
hastily turned toward a clump of spruce. The trees
concealed them and the sound grew nearer, until they
could see the dim shapes of men and horses moving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
through the driving flakes. Then they left cover and
spread out across the creek. The team stopped and an
angry voice came out of the snow:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this? What do you want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yon sled and its load,&#8221; the leader concisely replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand clear!&#8221; cried the voice. &#8220;Go right ahead,
Bill!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A man sprang forward and seized the near horse&#8217;s
head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop where you are!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;We&#8217;re not looking
for trouble, but we want the sled!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Two others ran out from behind the horses, but the
leader of the expedition raised his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s six to three, Mitcham, and that&#8217;s long odds.
Ye&#8217;ll get sled and team when ye claim them in camp.
Lift a fist and ye&#8217;ll give the boys the excuse they&#8217;re
wearying for. I&#8217;ll ask nothing better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mitcham turned to his companions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got us, boys. Leave them to it,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lead the horses, Kermode,&#8221; directed one of the
party, and the team moved on again while the leader,
walking beside the sled, hastily examined its load. Several
small cases lay beneath a tarpaulin.
</p>
<p>What became of Mitcham and his friends did not
appear, for they were left behind in the snow; but the
night grew wilder and the cold more biting. For minutes
together they could see nothing through the cloud of
flakes that drove furiously past them; it was hard to urge
the tired horses forward through the deeper drifts and all
were thankful when they came to reaches which the savage
wind had swept almost clear. They could not, however,
leave the creek without their knowing it, and they had a
fringe of willows, into which they stumbled now and then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
as guide. When, at length, the gorge opened out, there
was a high ridge to be crossed, and they had cause to
remember the ascent. The route led up through belts
of brush and between scattered pines, and leaving it
inadvertently every now and then, they got entangled
among the scrub. Two of them plodded at the stumbling
horses&#8217; heads, four pushed the sled, and at the top of
every steeper slope every one stopped and gasped for
breath. It was now near dawn and they had marched all
night after a day of heavy toil.
</p>
<p>The ascent made, they went down the hill at an
awkward run, the horses slipping with the sled pressing
on them, colliding with small trees, smashing through
matted brush, until they heard a hail. It was answered
and another body of men appeared and escorted them
into camp. Drowsy voices called to them and here and
there a man looked out as they passed the lines of shacks
and tents, but no word was spoken until they reached
their leader&#8217;s cabin. The cases were carried in and
while two of the company took the horses away the
others were given hot coffee and afterward sat down to
wait for morning. It was very cold and icy draughts
crept in, but they were undisturbed until daybreak,
when there was a cry outside:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Mitcham wanting to talk to you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A weary man, white with snow, entered and looked
eagerly round the shack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come for those cases,&#8221; he said, pointing to the
pile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What right have you to them?&#8221; Kermode inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What right?&#8221; cried the other. &#8220;They&#8217;re my property;
I bought them!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kermode smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You hear that; you&#8217;ll remember it, boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mitcham&#8217;s face grew dark as he saw the trap he had
fallen into.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I want them,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;You won&#8217;t
be wise to keep them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now see here,&#8221; said one of the party. &#8220;We have a
dozen men round this shack, and if there&#8217;s trouble, we
have only to call for more. Every boy knows what to do.
Strikes me it wouldn&#8217;t pay you to bring your hobos along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mitcham looked at the others and saw that they were
resolute. His enemies were masters of the situation.
Bluster and threats would not serve him; but it was
Kermode&#8217;s amusement which caused him the most
uneasiness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;keep them while you can. You&#8217;re
going to be sorry for this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went out and several of the men broke into a laugh.
They had, however, a problem to face later, when they
received a sharp message from the foreman demanding
their immediate return to work. All were willing to lose
a day&#8217;s pay, but the prompt dismissal which would
follow disobedience was a more serious matter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is that if we leave the shack without a
guard, Mitcham will steal his liquor back,&#8221; declared one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I had better see Mr. Morgan,&#8221; Kermode
suggested, and they let him go.
</p>
<p>The young engineer he interviewed listened with a
thoughtful air to the request that several of the workmen
should be given a day&#8217;s leave.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be awkward to let these fellows quit,&#8221; the
engineer protested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you would tell the foreman to send the boys I&#8217;ll
mention ahead up the track, so they couldn&#8217;t get back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
before evening, and give two of us a day off, it would get
over the difficulty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he heard the names the engineer looked hard at
Kermode.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has this request any connection with the collapse of
Mr. Ferguson&#8217;s church?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has, indirectly. I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t give you an
explanation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to understand how I&#8217;m situated. I may have
my sympathies, but I can&#8217;t be a partizan; my business is
to see you do your work. Suppose I do as you suggest,
will it make any trouble in the camp? I want a straight
answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Kermode. &#8220;I give you my word that what
we mean to do will lead to quietness and good order.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll have the boys you mentioned sent up the
track; they&#8217;re a crowd I&#8217;ve had my eye on. One of
your friends and you can lie off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kermode thanked him and went back to the shack,
where he kept watch with the leader of the Presbyterians
until two police troopers rode up late in the afternoon.
They opened the cases and heard Kermode&#8217;s story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You declare the man Mitcham claimed this liquor
as his property?&#8221; Sergeant Inglis asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He said he&#8217;d bought it. We&#8217;re ready to swear to
that, and we can give you the names of several more
who heard him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take them down. Where&#8217;s Mitcham?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They told him and he closed his notebook.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be sent for from Edmonton later. Don&#8217;t
let these cases out of your sight until Private Cooper calls
for them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went out and came back later with the trooper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
and a teamster they had hired, who loaded the cases on a
sled. Sergeant Inglis, however, sat still in his saddle,
with a watchful eye on Mitcham and another man who
stood, handcuffed, at his horse&#8217;s side. When the police
had ridden off with their prisoners, Morgan, the engineer,
sent for Kermode.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen the sergeant and he gave me an outline of
the affair,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was cleverly thought out&mdash;I
suppose the idea was yours?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t deny it,&#8221; returned Kermode modestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;see that your friends and you
begin work as usual to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>During the next two weeks Ferguson made some
progress in repairing the damage to his church. He
found several helpers, now that his strongest opponent
had been removed. The weather, however, grew more
severe and as the frost interfered with operations, men
were freely dismissed. One day Morgan and the
contractor&#8217;s clerk sat talking in the latter&#8217;s office.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to cut out two or three teams,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whom I ought to fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kermode,&#8221; Morgan advised promptly.
</p>
<p>The clerk looked surprised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Foreman reports him as a pretty good teamster.
He strikes me as smart and capable,&#8221; he objected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is. In fact, that&#8217;s the trouble. I like the man,
but you had better get rid of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re giving me a curious reason.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Morgan smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect our plans for the winter may lead to some
trouble with the boys; such work as we can carry on is
going to be severe. Now do you think it prudent to
provide them with a highly intelligent leader?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re right,&#8221; the clerk agreed. &#8220;He&#8217;ll
have to go, though I&#8217;m sorry to part with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send him to another job nearer the coast,&#8221; said
Morgan.
</p>
<p>The next day Kermode was informed of this decision
and took it good-humoredly. Before leaving the camp
he spent an evening with Ferguson, who expressed keen
regret at his departure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an idea that I may have got you into trouble,
and it hurts me,&#8221; the minister said.
</p>
<p>Kermode laughed in a reassuring manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;re wrong; but I&#8217;m not the first
man who has found a righteous cause unprofitable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; Ferguson returned gravely, &#8220;is in one sense
very true.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They sat up late, talking; and the next morning Kermode
found means of sending Foster&#8217;s horses back, and
then resumed his journey.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE PASSAGE OF THE MOUNTAINS</h3>
</div>

<p>Kermode had been gone a fortnight when Prescott
reached the camp and heard from Ferguson and
others of his latest exploit. He smiled as he listened
to their stories, but that he should find people willing to
talk about the man did not surprise him. Kermode was
not likely to pass unnoticed: his talents were of a kind
that seized attention. Where he went there was laughter
and sometimes strife; he had a trick of winning warm
attachment, and even where his departure was not regretted
he was remembered.
</p>
<p>Ferguson insisted on taking Prescott in, for his comrade&#8217;s
sake, and late one evening he sat talking with
him beside the stove. His house was rudely put together,
shingle-roofed and walled with shiplap boards that gave
out strong resinous odors. The joints were not tight and
stinging draughts crept in. Deep snow lay about the
camp and the frost was keen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t venture to predict Kermode&#8217;s movements,&#8221;
said the clergyman. &#8220;It was his intention to make for a
camp half-way to the coast, but he may change his mind
long before he gets there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Prescott replied; &#8220;that&#8217;s the kind of man
he is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ferguson smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You and Kermode strike me as differing in many
ways; yet you seem strongly attached to him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; Prescott assented. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see that
I owe him anything, and he once led me into a piece of
foolishness that nobody but himself could have thought of.
I knew the thing was crazy, but I did it when he urged me,
and I&#8217;ve regretted it ever since. Still, when I meet the
fellow I expect I shan&#8217;t have a word of blame for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a man I had a strong liking for, though on
many matters our points of view were opposite. However,
I dare say it&#8217;s something to be thankful for that
we&#8217;re not all made alike.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kermode&#8217;s unique,&#8221; Prescott explained. &#8220;I&#8217;m of
the plodding kind and I find that consequences catch me
up. Kermode&#8217;s different: he plunges into recklessness
and the penalty falls on somebody else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean by his connivance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never! It&#8217;s the last thing I meant. Kermode
never shirks. Bring a thing home to him and he&#8217;ll face it,
but somehow he generally escapes. There&#8217;s the matter
I mentioned&mdash;he and I played a fool trick, and while
he rambles about the country, flinging a foreman down
an embankment, assisting a lady in distress, posing as a
temperance reformer, in his usual inconsequent way, I&#8217;m
deep in trouble, and so are other people who don&#8217;t deserve
it. So far I&#8217;ve always reached the scene of his latest
exploit soon after he had left; but the man must be found.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ferguson laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Follow him to the Pacific, if necessary. As the
country isn&#8217;t opened up, he can&#8217;t get off the line.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re going to have a very rough journey.
The track&#8217;s surveyed and blazed; they&#8217;re working at it
in sections, but there are big gaps where nothing has been
done yet, and they have been withdrawing a large
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
number of men. Crossing the mountains is a tough
proposition in the winter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kermode didn&#8217;t seem afraid of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He started two weeks ago, when there had been less
snow. You&#8217;ll find it difficult to get through the passes
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; declared Prescott, &#8220;I have to get through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ferguson pondered the simple answer. It was, he
thought, typical of the man, and the contrast between
him and his friend became more forcible. Kermode
exercised a curious charm. His gay, careless nature
made him excellent company, and he had a strain of
somewhat eccentric genius; but he was irresponsible
and erratic, one could not depend on him. The Canadian
was of different temperament: slower, less subject to
impulse, but more stubborn and more consistent. When
dealing with him one would know what to expect. He
would reason out a purpose and then unwaveringly
adhere to it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the clergyman said, &#8220;you may have to cross a
big province; and though it&#8217;s warmer as you get down to
the coast, the weather&#8217;s often nearly arctic among the
ranges, while it&#8217;s only here and there that you&#8217;ll have a
chance to find shelter. It&#8217;s a trip that&#8217;s not to be undertaken
rashly. You&#8217;ll need a fur coat, among other
things, and I think I can get you one. You had better
take a couple of days&#8217; rest so as to start fresh. And
now it&#8217;s time for bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott spent the next day with him and left the
camp at daybreak on the second morning. He wore a
long coat, from which the fur had peeled in patches, and
carried a heavy pack besides a small ax. His boots were
dilapidated, but he had been unable to replace them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
There was sharp frost and when he boarded a construction
train he looked back at the camp with keen regret;
he shrank from the grim wilds ahead. A haze of smoke
hung over the clustering shacks, lights still blinked among
them, and already the nipping air was filled with sounds
of activity. Then the locomotive shrieked and he
turned his face toward the lonely white hills as the cars
moved forward with a jerk. It was bitterly cold, though
he lay down out of the wind behind the load of rails,
where hot cinders rattled about him and now and then
stung his face.
</p>
<p>At noon the train stopped. Alighting with cramped
limbs, Prescott saw that the rails went no farther. A few
shacks stood forlornly upon the hillside, a frozen river
wound like a white riband through the gorge beneath,
and ahead lay a sharply rising waste of rock and snow.
His path led across it, and after a word or two with the
men on the line he began his journey, breaking through
the thin, frozen crust. The sounds behind him grew
fainter and ceased; the trail of dingy smoke which had
followed him melted away, and he was alone in the
wilderness. His course was marked, however, by a pile
of stones here, a blazed tree there, and he plodded on all
day. When night came he found a hollow free from snow
beneath a clump of juniper, and lay awake, shivering
under his blankets. White peaks and snow-fields were
wrapped in deathly silence: there was not even the howl
of a prowling wolf or the splash of falling water.
</p>
<p>Rising at dawn, almost too cold to move, he could
find no dry wood to make a fire and had serious trouble
in getting on his frozen boots; and after a hurried meal
he set out again. It was some time before he felt moderately
warm, but with a short rest at noon, he held on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
until evening was near, when he camped in a deep rift
among the rocks filled with small firs. Here he found dry
branches, and made his supper, sitting between a sheltering
stone and a welcome fire. Soon afterward, he lay
down and slept until the piercing cold awakened him near
dawn. The fire had burned out to a few red embers;
he had some trouble in stirring it into life, and it was
bright daylight when he resumed his journey.
</p>
<p>He was too tired and generally too cold to retain any
clear impression of the next few days&#8217; march. There
were ranks of peaks above, glittering at times against an
intensely blue sky, but more often veiled in leaden cloud,
while rolling vapor hid their lower slopes. He skirted
tremendous gorges, looked up great hollows filled with
climbing trees, followed winding valleys, and at length
limped into sight of a lonely camp at the foot of a crag.
The light was fading when he reached it, though a lurid
sunset glowed behind the black firs on the crest of a
ridge, and the place had a desolate look. Most of the
shacks were empty, there were rings of branches with a
litter of old cans about them where tents had been pitched,
but a few toiling figures were scattered about a strip of
track. It was comforting to see them, but Prescott
was too jaded to notice what they were doing.
</p>
<p>Entering a shanty, roughly built of ties and galvanized
iron, he found a stove burning, and a Chinaman who told
him that supper would be ready soon. After a while
the men came in and, asking very few questions, gave
him a share of their meal; then he was shown a rude bed
of fir branches and swamp hay and told he could sleep
there. Prescott lay down and lighted his pipe and then
looked about for a while. The place was dimly lighted
and filled with rank tobacco smoke, through which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
saw the blurred figures of his new companions. Some
of them were playing cards under a lamp, some were
disputing in harsh voices, and now and then there was a
burst of laughter. Once or twice a man went out and
an icy draught swept through the shed, but except for
that it was delightfully warm. Soon Prescott&#8217;s pipe
dropped from his hand and, failing in a drowsy attempt
to find it, he went to sleep.
</p>
<p>At breakfast the next morning he learned that a man
answering Kermode&#8217;s description had spent a night there
eight or nine days ago. That showed that he was gaining,
and he forced his pace all day. At sunset he made a
fire beside a frozen lake, and after three or four days of
arduous toil reached another camp. From the few men
remaining there he learned that Kermode had left the
spot a week earlier with a companion whose work had
been interfered with by the frost. It was understood that
they intended to examine a mineral vein the railroad hand
had discovered in a valley some distance off, and when
Prescott had ascertained where it lay he set off on their
trail. The camp was well supplied with provisions and
he bought a quantity.
</p>
<p>He felt more cheerful now. It looked as if the end of
his long search were near, since there was every reason
to believe he would join the men before they could test
the claim. On the second day he laboriously ascended a
steep slope leading out of a valley he had followed, a
broken line of footprints running upward in front of him.
This seemed to indicate that the great ridge ahead could
be crossed, though when he glanced at the ramparts of
dark rock the task looked insuperable. Prescott knew
nothing of mountaineering, but he judged that Kermode&#8217;s
companion must be accustomed to the ranges.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>The slope grew sharper, there seemed to be an unbroken
wall of rock ahead; but, climbing higher, Prescott
saw a small smooth track running up the barrier. It was
obviously a gully filled with snow and its steepness
suggested that the ascent of it might prove beyond his
powers; but the footprints led on to where it began. After
following them to the spot, Prescott sat down on a stone
to gather breath. He looked upward with a sinking heart.
The hollow was deep and narrow&mdash;a cleft in the vast
ridge of rock, which was glazed with ice. In places it
looked precipitous, but there seemed to be no way of
working round the flank of the mountain. Then Prescott
noticed that the snow was pitted with small holes, about
two feet apart, from which he concluded that the
prospectors had carried a grubhoe, a tool resembling a
mountaineer&#8217;s ice-ax. He might get up by using these
footholds.
</p>
<p>Before starting he carefully adjusted his pack, and
slung the ax where it seemed least likely to do him an
injury. Then he found that by laying his mittened
hands in the holes above he could steady himself while
he found a fresh support for his feet, and for a while he
made progress, though the labor of carrying up his load
became intense. Coming to a fang of rock which offered
a precarious seat, he stopped and wondered how he was
to get up the rest of the way. It seemed a vast distance
to the top, and he was already distressed by a form of
exertion to which he was unaccustomed. Bright sunshine
rested on the jagged ridge above, but the gully
lay in shadow; and, growing cold, the man went on again.
The next few minutes passed uneventfully, except that
he made a dangerous slip; and then a stone rushed past
him and he heard a sharp crash below. This was a risk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
he had not counted on. Looking up anxiously, he saw
some snow coming down. There was not much of it,
but it was traveling ominously fast and he was right in
its path. He dared not leave the steps to seek the shelter
of the rocks. Driving in his feet to secure a better hold;
he waited, wondering whether he would be swept away
and hurled down to the bottom with broken bones.
</p>
<p>The sliding snow was close upon him; he saw that it
was spinning and of a flat round shape, not a ball as he
had expected, and then, while he dug in his hands and
stiffened every muscle to resist the shock, he received a
heavy blow on his lowered shoulder and a wet mass was
flung violently into his face. He held on, however, and
without looking around, heard the snow rush on down the
gully beneath him. After he had climbed a few yards, it
seemed possible to reach a projecting spur of rock, and
when he had carefully kicked out a hold for one foot he
made the attempt. He had scarcely reached the shelter
of the rock when there was a sharp crash above and a
great stone leaped by.
</p>
<p>Prescott found that he could maintain his position
fairly comfortably and he lighted his pipe and sat still
to rest and consider, while the downward rush of another
stone gave him food for thought. He believed he was
half-way up, and after the exertions he had made, it
was unthinkable that he should go back and seek another
route; besides, he doubted whether he could get down
without slipping. It seemed quite as perilous to go on,
until he reasoned from the state of the snow, which was not
deeply scored, that the stones did not come down continuously.
Perhaps the warmth of the sun, helped by a soft
chinook wind that had set in had loosened them; but the
light was fading off part of the ridge and if he waited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
a while, the discharge might cease. The trouble was
that he was getting very cold. He smoked another pipe,
and as he heard no further crashes, he cautiously ventured
out and regained the deepest part of the gully. His
joints ached, his muscles felt sore, but there was a break
in the rocks some distance higher up and he determined
to climb to it.
</p>
<p>The effort was severe, but he reached the spot, breathless,
and carefully looked about. The sunshine had now
vanished from the crest of the rocks and he supposed the
stones would soon freeze fast again, but there would be
only another hour or two of daylight and he must gain a
place of safety before it grew dark. An incautious movement
would precipitate him from his insecure refuge and
he could not contemplate his remaining there through
the night. Then he grew angry with Kermode.
</p>
<p>It was difficult to believe this was the easiest way into
the valley where the railroad man had made his discovery;
the latter, being used to the ranges, had, no doubt, taken
it to shorten the distance, and Kermode should have
objected. Kermode, however, never paused to think;
he cheerfully plunged into the first folly that appealed to
him and left other people to bear the consequences.
Then, having rested, Prescott saw that there were weak
points in this reasoning, since the man he was following
must have climbed the slope, and, what was more, that
his irritation led to no result. He could consider such
matters when he had reached the summit, and in order
to do so, he must get on at once.
</p>
<p>No more stones came down, but after Prescott had
gone some distance a fresh difficulty confronted him.
The gully was getting steeper, and the holes had disappeared;
he supposed that the snow had softened in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
the sunshine earlier in the day and slipping down had
filled up the recesses. He had, however, discovered
that one could kick through the hard crust and make a
hole to stand in, provided it were done carefully, and he
went up by this means, wondering whether his boots
would hold out until he reached the top, and stopping
every few yards for breath. It was exhausting work
after a long march and he was heavily loaded, but it
could not be shirked, and he crawled up, watching the
distance shorten foot by foot. Once a step broke away
and he slid back a yard before he brought up with hands
buried deep in the snow and the perspiration streaming
from him in his terror. Still, he was slowly mounting;
and at last, worn out and breathless, he reached the
narrow ridge of crag and looked down with keen relief
or a long slope to a valley filled with forest.
</p>
<p>In front there was a glorious vista of peaks that
shone in the evening light, but Prescott was in no mood
to think of them. He must get down to the trees, where
he could camp in comfort, before darkness fell. Rising
after a few minutes&#8217; rest, he made the descent and, as dusk
crept round him, lighted his fire among the sheltering
trunks.
</p>
<p>The next day he followed the valley through thick
timber and withered underbrush which tore his clothes
and delayed his march. There were fallen trunks with
spreading branches to be scrambled over, and tangles of
thorny canes, but he was cheered by signs that somebody
had passed on ahead of him not long before. Later, the
forest died out and the bottom of the hollow was strewn
with sharp-edged stones, which threatened to tear his worn
boots from his feet, and which added seriously to his toil.
It was, however, impossible that the prospectors had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
climbed the crags that hemmed him in, and believing they
could not be far in front of him, he held on until late in
the afternoon.
</p>
<p>At length he came to a wider stretch, out of which
a ravine that looked accessible led, but he gave little
thought to it. There were a few small trees about
and one of them had recently been felled. He could
see the white chips and the place where a fire had burned.
A meat-can lay near-by and when Prescott picked it up
he found the few fragments adhering to it quite fresh.
The men he sought had camped there, but he began to
grow anxious, for he could see no signs of them. Laying
down his load, he made a hasty examination of the locality
and found a spot where the face of a crag was marked by
a streak of different material. It was rent in one place,
heavy fragments were scattered about, and Prescott saw
that they had been blown out with giant-powder.
</p>
<p>For a few minutes he eagerly proceeded with his
search, but he could find no blankets or provision cache,
and when he saw footprints leading toward the ravine the
truth dawned on him. The prospectors had left the spot
and were not coming back; once more he had arrived too
late. It was a cruel disappointment and he sat down in
black dejection, looking heavily about. The high summits
were wrapped in leaden cloud, the lower rocks
towered above him, rugged and forbidding, and a mournful
wind wailed through the gorge.
</p>
<p>With an effort he forced himself to think. He had
provisions for only a day or two; one of the prospectors
was obviously an expert mountaineer, which led Prescott
to believe that they would travel faster than he was capable
of doing. It would be the height of rashness to
push on farther into the wilds without a guide, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
first fall of snow would blot out any trail the others might
have left. Reason warned him that he must turn back;
but it was unthinkable that he should descend the gully.
He determined to climb the ravine on the morrow.
</p>
<p>Growing cold, he fell to work with the ax, and soon
had a fire burning in a hollow among the rocks.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>DEFEAT</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning Prescott awakened in the dark and
set to work, shivering, to rekindle his fire. Day
broke with a transitory brightness while he had breakfast
and soon afterward he entered the ravine. It was
steep, and filled with ice in places, but freshly dislodged
stones and scratches on the rocks showed him that the
prospectors had gone that way. The ascent was difficult:
it cost him a tense effort now and then to gain a
slippery ledge or to scramble up a slab, and he had
frequently to stop and consider how he could best force a
passage.
</p>
<p>He was tired and damp with perspiration when he
reached the top and met an icy wind that swept across a
tableland. The high plain was strewn with rocky fragments,
the peaks above were lost in vapor, but he saw
by a glance at the watery sun that it ran roughly west;
and footprints led across it with an inclination toward the
south. This was comforting, because the line of track
ran to the south, and if he could strike that, it would
serve as a guide; moreover it confirmed Prescott&#8217;s conclusion
that Kermode, who had evidently found the
mineral vein worthless, would hold on toward the sea.
He was not the man to haunt familiar ground when a
wide, newly opened country lay before him.
</p>
<p>Then a few stinging flakes struck Prescott&#8217;s face,
the pale sunshine was blotted out, and a savage blast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
drove him back to the shelter of the ravine. For an
hour he sat, shivering, among the rocks while the gorge
was swept by snow. When it ceased he came out; but
there was no sign of a footprint now and, to make things
worse, the new snow was soft. But he plodded through
it, heading southwest, so as to strike the track again, a
little farther on.
</p>
<p>He spent the day on the high ground; at times toilsomely
picking a way across banks of stones buried in
snow that hid the dangerous gaps between them. Now
and then he sank through the treacherous covering and
plunged into a hollow, at the risk of breaking his leg;
but walking was easier between these tracts, and when
evening came he reached a few large fallen rocks, among
which he camped and lay awake, half frozen, without a
fire. Starting as soon as day broke, he felt that he must
make the surveyed line before dark. He was growing
afraid of the white desolation and wanted to get into
touch with something that would lead him to the haunts
of men.
</p>
<p>It was afternoon when he came to a great dip. A
valley lay beneath him with a frozen river winding
through its depths, and he felt convinced that it was one
the track would follow. The trouble, however, was
to get down, for the hillside fell away in a vast scarp,
broken here and there by dark crags that showed through
the snow. There was a belt of timber a long way down,
but the slope was too steep for him to reach it, and he
walked along the summit in search of a spot from which
the descent could be made, until he came to a long
declivity that looked a little less sharp. Then, strapping
his fur coat on his pack, he kicked a step in the snow and
began to climb down, facing inward toward the bank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>For a while, he made steady progress; and then the
snow grew harder. Its surface had melted and frozen
again, resulting in a crust that could scarcely be penetrated.
He thought about his ax, but he could not see
how he could use it in cutting steps beneath him without
falling down, and this was not the place for hazardous
experiments. He went on very cautiously, finding the
work of kicking hollows for his feet extremely severe,
until, when he supposed that half an hour had passed,
he drove his toes in deep and lay down to rest. On
looking up, he seemed to have come a very short distance,
and when he glanced below he felt appalled at the length
of the declivity he must still creep down. His limbs
ached; his mittens were worn and his hands badly
numbed; and one boot was coming to pieces.
</p>
<p>The descent, however, must be continued, and he
began to move again, very warily. Presently he found
he could not break through the crust with his foot.
Clinging hard to his handhold, he lowered himself to
feel for a softer spot. His toe went in a little way; he
ventured to trust to the slight support; but as he did
so the treacherous snow broke beneath him. For a
few tense moments his numbed fingers held him to the
slope. He tried in terror to kick another hole; the attempt
failed, his hands slipped away, and he began to
slide downward, the snow driving up into his face.
The pace grew rapidly faster; he could not keep himself
straight, but slid on his side; then his pack caught
something that turned him farther round so that his
head was lowest. He could see nothing; his pace grew
frightful, and he drove on, unable to make the least
effort.
</p>
<p>How long this continued he had no idea. It was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
terrifying experience; but at length, to his dull astonishment,
his speed slackened suddenly and he stopped.
He found that he was whole in limb, and on getting up
cautiously he was forced to the conclusion that he was
little the worse for his rapid descent. His clothes were
packed with snow, but it was easily shaken out. After
recovering a little, he saw that he had brought up on a
slope that fell less sharply and that it would be possible
to walk down it without much trouble. The timber
was close ahead, and he smiled as he remembered his
horror; it looked as if he might have made the descent
uninjured if he had calmly sat down and let himself go.
</p>
<p>Moving downward among the trees, he had almost
reached the bottom of the valley when he came upon
a belt of rugged stones, and in picking a path across
them slipped and fell. He was not much hurt, but
when he went on again his foot felt sore and he was
limping when he reached the river. One or two trees
near it had been chopped, and a spur of rock lower
down had its summit marked by a pole. He had reached
the line of track, and he followed it west, having heard
there was a camp farther on, though his informants did
not know whether it was now occupied. It was, however,
a relief to stop among a clump of spruce at dusk. When
he had made a fire he examined his foot. There was no
sign of injury except that ankle and instep were rather
red, and he went to sleep reassured.
</p>
<p>In the morning he was surprised to find that the
foot was painful and that the back of his leg felt strained.
He would have been tempted to remain in camp only
that his provisions were nearly exhausted, and after a
meager breakfast he resumed the march. The bottom
of the valley was level, the timber thin, but there was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
good deal of brush to be struggled through and before
long he was forced to take to the winding river. By
noon it cost him a determined effort to walk, for his foot
was extremely painful and his leg getting sore. As he
did not know how far off the camp was, it seemed
prudent to save the food he had left, and he limped on,
his lips tight-set.
</p>
<p>The snow-covered ice was smooth, but the bends
of the river increased the distance wofully; there was a
keen wind, and the dark pines stretched on without a
break as far as he could see. As he entered each fresh
loop of the stream he looked eagerly for an opening or
sign of life, but there were only rows of ragged spires,
cutting sharply against the sky. He felt inexpressibly
lonely and badly afraid; the desolation was growing appalling,
and he could not keep on his feet much longer.
He had food enough for two scanty meals, and then, if no
help came, he must starve.
</p>
<p>There was now a pain which grew rapidly worse
in his left side; his shoulders ached beneath his load,
and every joint was sore with the effort it cost him to
save his injured foot. The sun sank lower, and the
trees still ran on ahead. Indeed, they were growing
thicker, and he could see only a short distance into the
avenues between the great colonnades of trunks. The
loops of the river doubled more closely; in spite of his
exertion he was getting very little farther down the
valley; but an attempt to push through the forest led
him into such tangles of fallen trunks and branches
that he was forced back to the ice.
</p>
<p>At length he reached a spot where a fire had swept the
bush. Branches and clustering needles had been burned
away; the trees ran up in bare, charred columns, black
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
when looked at closely, in the distance a curious silvery
gray. Prescott could see ahead between them, and he
stopped with his heart beating rapidly, for on the white
hillside some distance off stood a few shacks. This was
the camp, and in spite of the pain it cost him he increased
his pace, driven by keen suspense. He did not know
if there were men yonder, and he could see no smoke.
The doubt grew tormenting; leaving the stream farther
on, he struck into unburned bush that hid the camp from
him. There were thorny brakes and thickets of withered
ferns, but though progress was excruciatingly painful he
smashed through them furiously. He was hot and breathless;
it was insufferable that he should be delayed among
the timber in anxiety. Breaking out into the open, he
sent up a hoarse cry, for a thin trail of vapor curled above
one of the shacks. Then a man appeared in the doorway
and waved a hand to him.
</p>
<p>Prescott felt suddenly limp and nerveless; now that
help was near at hand, he wanted to sit down; but he
held on until he limped into the hut, where two men
stood awaiting him. They were strong, weather-beaten
fellows, dressed in quaintly patched garments, and they
looked good-humored.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come right in,&#8221; said one. &#8220;Pull that box up to
the fire and sit down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott was glad to obey, and when he had taken off
his pack he looked about the shack. It was substantially
built: stones and soil had been used in its construction
as well as boards and bark. It was warmed by a
big open fire and contained a table, besides a few tubs
and cases which served as seats. A bunk neatly made of
split boards and filled with spruce twigs and swamp hay
ran along one end.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Can you take me in for a day or two?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve hurt my foot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said the second man. &#8220;I noticed you were
walking lame. We&#8217;re well stocked in groceries and Steve
got a deer a day or two ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get your stores?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The contractor brought them up. There was quite
a camp here; company putting in all the preliminary work
that could be done with the shovel. They shut down
when the frost came, but we figured we&#8217;d stay on, and
took over part of the supplies. The boss had more
truck than he could pack down to the other camps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s nobody else about the place?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said the first man; &#8220;they&#8217;re all gone. It&#8217;s
kind of lonely, but we&#8217;re doing some chopping for the
road, and we&#8217;ll be right here with money saved when work
begins in spring. Bought a piece of fruit land, part on
mortgage, at a snap, and with good luck we&#8217;ll have it
clear when we go back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The short explanation supplied a clue to the characters
of the men, who with an eye to the future preferred to
face the rigors of the north rather than to spend the
winter hanging round the saloons on the warmer coast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; inquired the other, &#8220;where did you come
from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott mentioned the last camp he had visited and
gave them a few particulars about his journey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you came down the Long Bench&mdash;pretty
tough proposition that! And kept the trail on short
rations!&#8221; one of his hosts remarked. &#8220;Suppose you
take a smoke, and I&#8217;ll get supper a little earlier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before long he was given a share of a simple but
abundant meal, and after it was over sat talking with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
hosts. It was dark outside now, but although the men
had run out of oil for the lamp, the fire gave them light,
and pungent odors issued from the resinous logs. The
room was warm and, by comparison with the frozen
wilderness, supremely comfortable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with your foot?&#8221; one of the men
asked when Prescott took off his boot.
</p>
<p>Prescott described how it felt, though he explained that
he could find no sign of injury, and the other nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ricked it a bit; got one of the ligaments or something
kinked,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Known that happen when there
wasn&#8217;t much to show. You had better lie off for a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It occurred to Prescott that he might be in much worse
quarters, though he shrank from the delay a rest would
entail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What took you up the gully and over the Bench,
anyway?&#8221; the man went on.
</p>
<p>Prescott explained and then asked: &#8220;Have you come
across my partner or the other fellow, Hollin?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never seen your partner.&#8221; The man looked at
his comrade and laughed. &#8220;But we know Hollin, all
right. Got an idea that he&#8217;s a boss prospector and froze
on to the railroad job because it took him into the mountains.
Been all round looking for minerals; got fired
for it at one or two camps, and never struck anything
worth speaking of. It&#8217;s a point on which he&#8217;s certainly
a crank.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was characteristic of Kermode, Prescott thought,
that he should be willing to accompany a man with a
craze of the kind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d expected to find them here. I understood they
didn&#8217;t mean to go back to the camp at Butler Ridge,&#8221;
he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen their tracks, and if they were heading
west, they&#8217;d have to come down this valley; but I guess
nobody could tell where Hollin would make for. Of
course, you can&#8217;t prospect much in winter with everything
frozen up and the snow about, but so long as he
can trail through the mountains and find a few clean
rocks the man will be happy; and I&#8217;ll allow that he&#8217;s
smart at it. Knows how to fix a camp, and find a deer,
if there&#8217;s one in the country. It&#8217;s a sure thing he&#8217;ll
have to strike for a camp or store sooner or later; but it&#8217;s
likely he has crossed the line south and is trying to make
the Fraser and the settlements along the Canadian Pacific
railroad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was bad news to Prescott. He knew enough about
the Pacific Province to realize that if his host&#8217;s suppositions
were correct, he would have a vast area to search;
a region of stony uplands, mountain chains, and rock-walled
valleys.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it be possible for me to get through?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir! You don&#8217;t want to think of it. Guess
your partner will be pretty safe with Hollin; but you&#8217;re a
plainsman and you&#8217;d sure get lost in a day or two and
starve when your grub ran out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed the other man. &#8220;The thing
can&#8217;t be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott fell in with his opinion. It would, he thought,
require a number of expert mountaineers to trace the
men he sought through the desolation of rock and forest
to the south. Besides, British Columbia was well populated
along the Canadian Pacific line, from which many
avenues of communication opened up, and there would be
a strong probability of his missing Kermode.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said reluctantly, &#8220;perhaps, I had better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
stop round here in case they keep this track; and my
foot&#8217;s too sore to let me move. Could you put me up
for a week or two? I&#8217;ll try to make it worth your while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop as long as you want,&#8221; Steve responded. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
have to charge you for the grub, because we paid quite
a pile for it, but we&#8217;ll only strike you for your share.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Prescott, and the others began to
talk of Hollin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If that man would let up on prospecting he&#8217;d get
rich,&#8221; declared one. &#8220;When a survey outfit goes up
into the bush, Hollin&#8217;s picked for the boss packer&#8217;s job,
and when there&#8217;s a new wagon road to be staked out they
generally put him on. A smart man at striking the
easiest line through rough country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Steve. &#8220;Trouble is that he can&#8217;t
stay with it. Soon as he collects some pay, he goes off
on the prospecting trail, and then heads for Vancouver
with a bag of specimens that aren&#8217;t worth anything.
When the mineral men hear of a new Hollin discovery
they smile. Guess he&#8217;s found most everything&mdash;gold,
copper, zinc, and platinum&mdash;and never made fifty cents
out of them, &#8217;cept once when, so the boys say, a mining
company fellow gave him five dollars to promise he
wouldn&#8217;t worry him again. Now they&#8217;ve orders in all
the offices that if Hollin comes round with any more specimens
they&#8217;re not to let him in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott laughed. The man he had heard described
was Kermode&#8217;s companion, and he could imagine their
wandering up and down the province, one as irresponsible
as the other; meeting with strange experiences, stubbornly
braving the perils of the wilds; making themselves
a nuisance to business men in the cities. The matter
had, however, a more serious aspect. Prescott had spent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
some time on the useless search and he could not continue
it throughout the winter. It would be futile to
speculate on the movements of men so erratic as those he
had followed. He could not neglect his farm, and he had
a heavy crop to haul in and sell: this was a duty that
must be attended to.
</p>
<p>If he went back without Jernyngham, and Curtis still
clung to his theory, the police might give him trouble;
but he must run that risk. Though convinced of it, he
had no means of proving that Jernyngham was wandering
through British Columbia in company with a crazy
prospector.
</p>
<p>After a while he grew drowsy and got into the bunk,
where he lay down, enjoying the warmth and softness of
the spruce twigs until he went to sleep.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>PRESCOTT&#8217;S RETURN</h3>
</div>

<p>It was Saturday evening, clear and cold, though the
frost was not intense. A number of the farmers and
their wives had driven in to Sebastian to meet their
friends and make their weekly purchases. A row of
light rigs stood outside the livery-stable, voices and
laughter rose from the sidewalks; the town looked cheerful
and almost picturesque with its roofs and tall elevator
towers cutting against the soft night sky.
</p>
<p>A full moon hung above them, but its silvery radiance
was paled by other lights. Warm gleams shone out from
the store windows upon the hard-trodden snow; a train of
lighted cars stood at the station, and the intense white
glare of the head-lamp mingled with the beam flung far
across the prairie by a freight locomotive on a side-track.
Groups of people strolled up and down the low platform,
waiting to see the train go out, and their voices
rang merrily on the frosty air. From one of the great
shadowy elevators there came a whirr of wheels.
</p>
<p>When the train rolled away into the wilderness, Muriel
Hurst entered the hotel and went upstairs to the parlor
where Colston and her sister were sitting. The room was
furnished in defective taste, but it was warm and brightly
lighted, and the girl had got accustomed to the smell of
warm iron diffused by the stove and the odor of burning
kerosene. Colston occupied an easy-chair, and when
Muriel took off her furs he looked up with a smile,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
noticing the fine color the nipping air had brought into
her face. She looked braced and vigorous, but it struck
him that she wore a thoughtful expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you buy all you wanted?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I got what I came for.&#8221; Muriel sat down and
handed her sister a parcel. &#8220;I think that ought to match.
Has Harry been lounging there since supper? Isn&#8217;t he
the picture of comfortable laziness?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colston laughed. He was still very neatly dressed,
but he looked harder than he had when he first reached
the prairie and his face was brown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m content, and that&#8217;s a great thing,&#8221; he rejoined.
&#8220;Indeed, I&#8217;ll confess that I could enjoy our stay here,
except for the damping effect of our friends&#8217; trouble.
It&#8217;s astonishing how little one misses the comforts we
insist on in England, and I&#8217;m coming to take an interest
in the visits we pay among the ranches and our weekly
trip to Sebastian. Then nobody could maintain that
your sister looks any the worse for her experience. I&#8217;m beginning
to think she might pass for a wheat-grower&#8217;s wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard Mrs. Johnson ask when you were going to
take a farm,&#8221; Muriel retorted. &#8220;It would be difficult
to imagine you tramping down a furrow behind a plow
or driving one of those smelly gasoline tractors; but
you&#8217;ll be able to pose before your constituents as an
authority on colonial questions when you go home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid they&#8217;ll throw me over unless they see me
soon; but there&#8217;s nothing else to take me back, and I&#8217;d
feel we were deserting our friends in their distress.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t leave them yet,&#8221; Mrs. Colston broke in.
&#8220;The suspense is preying upon Jernyngham. He&#8217;s getting
dangerously moody; I know Gertrude feels anxious
about him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>A curious expression crept into Muriel&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Believing what he does, it&#8217;s natural that he should
clamor for justice, but he&#8217;s becoming possessed by a
feverish cruelty. It&#8217;s mastering him, destroying his
judgment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re alluding to his suspicions of Prescott?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel&#8217;s eyes sparkled as she took up the challenge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know as well as I do that they&#8217;re altogether
wrong! It&#8217;s impossible that he should be guilty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One would like to think so,&#8221; her sister responded
with dry reserve. &#8220;But it&#8217;s a pity he ran away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel could not deny this. She had retained her
faith in Prescott, but his silence about the motive for an
absence that must tell against him troubled her. It was
strange that he had given her no hint, and she felt hurt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He may have gone because he could not bear to be
distrusted,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You are both sorry for Jernyngham,
but don&#8217;t you think the man he unjustly suspects
deserves some pity?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Colston, &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to keep an open mind.
Prejudice, of course, should not be pandered to; but one
is as likely to be led astray by too strong a partiality for
the suspected person.&#8221; He paused before he added:
&#8220;However, I envy you your confidence; I liked the
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The worst of it is that the matter may go dragging
on until it wears Gertrude and her father out,&#8221; Mrs.
Colston remarked. &#8220;It would be a relief in some ways
to learn the truth, however bad it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Prescott has no reason to dread the truth&#8217;s coming
out,&#8221; said Muriel staunchly.
</p>
<p>Then a maid came in to announce that their team was
ready, and, putting on her furs, Muriel went down in advance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
of the others to see that her purchases had been
placed together. After she had gone, Mrs. Colston looked
at her husband.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it would be advisable to mention Prescott as
seldom as possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; Colston agreed. &#8220;I wonder whether you
have noticed anything unusual in the relations between
Muriel and Gertrude of late? They used to be good
friends in England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have remarked some signs of strain. But it is not a
matter you could be expected to take an interest in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Colston rejoined deprecatingly, and went
down with his wife.
</p>
<p>Leslie&#8217;s team and a smart sleigh, which Jernyngham
had had sent out from Toronto, stood at the door, and
after he had helped his wife and Muriel in, Colston took
the reins. When they had jolted across the track, the
snow was beaten smooth along the trail; the team was
fresh after resting, and it was a brilliant night. They set
off at an exhilarating speed, and though their faces tingled
they kept warm beneath their furs and driving-robes.
Far in front of them spread the prairie, gleaming white
beneath the moon; no cloud stained the vault of soft deep
blue, and the drumming of the hoofs rang out in merry
rhythm. The crisp cold, which was less marked than
usual, stirred the blood.
</p>
<p>They passed a buggy, drawn by a good horse, and later
a light wagon, for the snow does not, as a rule, lie deep on
the western prairie and the farmers largely continue the
use of wheels. After that for some time they were alone
on the waste, until as they approached a tract of broken
country a wagon appeared on the crest of a rise, with the
double span of horses in front of it cutting sharply black
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
against the snow. It came on slowly, heavily loaded
with bags of grain, and then the dark shape of a man who
walked beside the team grew visible. As they came closer,
Colston turned his horses out of the trail to let the wagon
pass, and then started as the moonlight fell on the teamster&#8217;s
face. It was Prescott.
</p>
<p>For a moment he hesitated, and then pulled up, acknowledging
the man&#8217;s greeting with a lifted hand. Mrs.
Colston, however, said nothing, and Prescott stood quietly
by his horses&#8217; heads, until Muriel called him forward
and gave him her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you get back?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Late last night. We broke the wheat bin this morning,
and I&#8217;m taking the first load in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But where were you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In Alberta and British Columbia most of the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He volunteered no further information and there was an
awkward pause, for Prescott had noticed that Colston had
been undecided whether to drive on or not. Mrs. Colston
sat farthest from him, so that he could not see her, but
she had not addressed him yet. It was clear that his appearance
had affected them unpleasantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When we next meet, you must tell us about your trip,&#8221;
said Muriel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We should be interested to hear about it,&#8221; Colston
added lamely, and Prescott forced a smile. Muriel
was the only one who had treated him on the old friendly
footing; and he could hardly visit the Leslie homestead,
even if he were invited, while Jernyngham was there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may see you some time, and I mustn&#8217;t keep you
now,&#8221; he responded.
</p>
<p>He started his team, and Colston turned to his companions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll confess that I&#8217;ve had a great surprise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, you imagined that Mr. Prescott had gone
for good!&#8221; said Muriel with scorn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I had some idea of that nature. He
would hardly have come back if he were guilty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Muriel mockingly, &#8220;you really can&#8217;t tell
what an unscrupulous, bold man might do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Spare me,&#8221; Colston begged with a laugh. &#8220;After
all, it looks as if you have been right.&#8221; He turned to
his wife. &#8220;What do you think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Prescott&#8217;s guilt or innocence is a question I
can&#8217;t decide; but in making us believe he was Cyril
Jernyngham he did a very wrong and foolish thing.
That Cyril may have urged him to do so is no excuse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leaving Mr. Prescott out, I think Cyril&#8217;s idea was a
very generous one,&#8221; Muriel declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you believe that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have wished to save his father and sister
pain, and he knew the trick would cost him a good deal.
For one thing, it would prevent his going home to be
reinstated, because of course if he had done so, we
would have seen he was not the man we had met in
Canada. He meant to stay here, refusing to benefit by
the change in his affairs, out of consideration for his
relatives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you approve his passing off this western farmer
for a Jernyngham?&#8221; Mrs. Colston asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that!&#8221; Muriel&#8217;s laugh was scornful. &#8220;You
were satisfied with the man until you knew his name was
Prescott. How was it that you didn&#8217;t miss the inherent
superiority of the Jernynghams? Besides, I can&#8217;t think
Cyril suffered by getting his friend to represent him.
Though people won&#8217;t talk very freely, I&#8217;ve picked up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
some information since I&#8217;ve been here, enough to show
what kind of man Cyril was. He hadn&#8217;t much to boast
of, and one must do him the justice to admit that he seems
to have recognized it. You probably know, though you
hid it from me, that on the evening he should have met
us he was lying in the hotel after getting badly hurt in a
drunken brawl among some riotous Orangemen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t have any reflections cast upon Orangemen,&#8221;
Colston objected. &#8220;There are a large number in my
constituency; most worthy people, for whom I&#8217;ve a
strong respect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a respect for their votes, you mean,&#8221;
Muriel rejoined. &#8220;You know you&#8217;re really ritualistic
High Church. If your constituents knew as much about
St. Cuthbert&#8217;s as I do, they would turn you out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never hid my convictions,&#8221; Colston declared.
&#8220;Anyway, I have ascertained that the greater proportion
of the Orangemen were sober.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; retorted Muriel, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that Cyril was not.
But there are more important points to consider.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very true,&#8221; said Mrs. Colston. &#8220;Will you
tell Jernyngham that we have seen Prescott, Harry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colston hesitated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t think so. I&#8217;m afraid of the effect it
may have on him; and he won&#8217;t be up when we get in.
All the same, he&#8217;s bound to hear the news from somebody
else very soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Neither of the others answered, and they drove on in
silence until the lights of the Leslie homestead blinked
across the snow. The cheerfulness which had marked
the party when they set out had gone; they felt a sense of
constraint, and Muriel wondered uneasily whether she
had spoken with too much freedom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>The next morning they were sitting with Jernyngham
and Gertrude when a neighboring rancher came in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Leslie might be here,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t mean to intrude.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colston knew the man and he asked him to sit down.
Jernyngham glanced up from the Winnipeg paper he
was reading. His face was worn and had set into a
fixed, harsh expression, but his manner conveyed a hint
of eagerness; of late it had suggested that he was continually
expecting something.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I drove over to give Leslie a message,&#8221; the newcomer
continued. &#8220;I guess you have heard that Prescott&#8217;s
back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham started and dropped the paper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Prescott back? You must be mistaken!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir! Spoke to him on the trail last night. He
was hauling in a load to the settlement, and I was driving
home half an hour after Mr. Colston.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one trail,&#8221; said Jernyngham, looking
hard at Colston. &#8220;You must have met the fellow.
Why didn&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colston showed confusion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell the truth, I was afraid the news might
distress and excite you. You couldn&#8217;t do anything until
Monday, and I thought it better to let you spend to-day
in peace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In peace!&#8221; Jernyngham laughed in a jarring manner.
&#8220;Tormented as I am by suspense that grows beyond
endurance!&#8221; His eyes glittered and the lines on his
face deepened. &#8220;And I&#8217;m to be kept in ignorance
while the villain who robbed and killed my son goes
about his work undisturbed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was an awkward silence for a few moments.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
Mrs. Colston looked distressed, and Gertrude regarded
Muriel with a long searching glance. The girl felt
that she was being suspected of abetting her brother-in-law
for some ulterior purpose. She was of sanguine
temperament and wayward temper, and her blood ran
warm; but she held in check the anger that she burned
to give expression to. Then their visitor, whom they
had forgotten, broke in:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, sir, you&#8217;re getting ahead too fast. There&#8217;s
nothing proved against Prescott, and I and others know
he never did the thing!&#8221; He paused and Muriel,
regardless of her companions, flung him a grateful glance
as he went on: &#8220;Even Curtis can&#8217;t bring it home to him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Curtis,&#8221; said Jernyngham contemptuously, &#8220;is a cautious
fool! I&#8217;ll communicate with his chiefs at Regina.&#8221;
He got up with a decided air. &#8220;I&#8217;ll start for Sebastian at
once. Where&#8217;s Leslie? I must see him about a team.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay where you are,&#8221; said the farmer, with rude
sympathy. &#8220;I heard that one of the police bosses will
be at the settlement to-morrow and you can see him then;
Curtis took a room for him at the hotel. I&#8217;m telling you
because the sooner all this muss is cleared up the better,
and it won&#8217;t hurt Prescott.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went out and Jernyngham, without speaking to
the others, picked up his paper. Muriel took a book
from a shelf, but although she determinedly tried to fix
her attention on it, she could make no sense of what she
read. It was a dreary morning; Colston was soon driven
out, and the others were oppressed by a feeling of constraint
and tension. They were glad when Jernyngham
and Gertrude started for Sebastian in the afternoon.
After they had gone, Colston looked at his wife and
sister-in-law dolefully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This kind of thing will tell upon your nerves; I&#8217;m
beginning to feel it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We must have a long
drive to-morrow to get rid of the depression. Those
people on the ranch by the bluff pressed us to come back
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many excuses for our friends; you couldn&#8217;t
expect them to be cheerful,&#8221; Mrs. Colston replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very true; one must try to remember it. It
seems our duty to remain and comfort them as much
as possible; but I can&#8217;t say that they&#8217;re always very
grateful. Indeed, I have felt hurt by Gertrude&#8217;s reserve,
though, considering how trying all this must be for her,
one can&#8217;t take exception to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gertrude knows her brother is alive!&#8221; said Muriel
coldly.
</p>
<p>Her sister cast a keen glance at her, while Colston,
made a sign of expostulation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I scarcely think you have any right to say that; but
I&#8217;ll confess that I&#8217;m wavering in my opinions&mdash;Prescott&#8217;s
return has had its effect on me. In fact, the mystery&#8217;s
getting deeper and more fascinating; I feel impelled to
wait and see it unraveled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is hardly the way to regard it,&#8221; his wife rebuked
him. &#8220;I would rather remember that the Jernynghams
have a strong claim on our sympathy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the main consideration, of course. But we&#8217;ll
decide on the drive to-morrow. It has been a depressing
day.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>MURIEL RELIEVES HER MIND</h3>
</div>

<p>On the Monday morning, Jernyngham was shown
into the parlor of the hotel where a commissioned
officer of the police sat waiting for him. He had keen,
observant eyes, but his manner was quiet, and Jernyngham
endeavored to control his impatience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you know that Prescott has returned to his
farm?&#8221; he said, taking the chair the other pointed to.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been informed so,&#8221; the officer replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then may I ask what you mean to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have come to no decision.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But your men have a warrant for him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The officer changed his position and his expression
hinted at forbearance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so. On the whole, I think it should not have
been issued.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not let the fellow&#8217;s return influence you
unduly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very true,&#8221; said the other with a calm which Jernyngham
found maddening. &#8220;It would be unwise to infer
too much from that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a bold man; he has, no doubt, counted on the
effect his coming back would have,&#8221; Jernyngham urged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible,&#8221; the officer agreed.
</p>
<p>Jernyngham&#8217;s nerves had given way beneath the
strain he had borne, and he now stood up, trembling with
anger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Am I to understand that you intend to leave the
fellow alone? Now, when he is within your reach, you
will not arrest him? The scoundrel killed my son!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Might I suggest your sitting down again?&#8221; said the
officer calmly. &#8220;Let me try to put the matter before
you as we look at it. To begin with, we can&#8217;t very well
press the charge you make against Prescott without some
proof of the victim&#8217;s death, which has not been discovered
yet. The muskeg, I must remind you, was drained and
nothing found. The handsome reward you offered led
to no result, though every man in the district who had any
time to spare spent it in searching the bluffs. Corporal
Curtis has made systematic investigations, but they have
been fruitless.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Corporal Curtis is a man of whose intelligence I
have a very poor opinion!&#8221; said Jernyngham hotly.
</p>
<p>His companion smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a point upon which I don&#8217;t altogether share
your views.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In short, you intend to let the matter drop! I must
protest against such a scandalous failure of justice! But
you shall not let it drop; I warn you that I shall apply to
Ottawa, where there are people who can put upon you
the pressure that seems to be needed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A look of weariness crept into the officer&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have my sympathy, Mr. Jernyngham, but you
can&#8217;t be allowed to interfere with the Northwest Police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham pulled himself together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no wish to be offensive, though I meant what I
said. Suppose this fellow goes off again&mdash;for good&mdash;as
soon as he has sold his wheat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will have to be guarded against. He will be
watched; if he leaves his farm, he will be followed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He gave you the slip neatly on a previous occasion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite true,&#8221; said the officer. &#8220;Our men are not
infallible. I think I can promise that it will not happen
again.&#8221; Then he rose. &#8220;I have some business waiting
and you must excuse me. I can assure you that nothing
which promises to throw any light upon the matter will
be neglected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He opened the door and politely but firmly bowed out
his visitor. Then he called Curtis, who was waiting
below.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say you can guess Mr. Jernyngham&#8217;s errand,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Unless we can hit on the truth before long,
you&#8217;ll have that gentleman in the guard-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis looked astonished and his superior smiled compassionately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean as a sufferer from mental derangement.
Don&#8217;t be communicative, and confine yourself to reassuring
generalities, if you come across him. His mind&#8217;s
morbidly fixed on punishing Prescott. I don&#8217;t think he
can be convinced that the man is innocent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help meeting him, sir. He spends his time
following me about. In a way, one can&#8217;t blame him for
what he thinks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Though it doesn&#8217;t agree with your conclusions?
Sit down; we have a number of things to talk about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; said Curtis, &#8220;this is certainly a mixed-up
case. I&#8217;ve said nothing all along to disturb people&#8217;s
belief that it was Prescott we were after, but if I had to corral
one of the two, I&#8217;d get Wandle. The land agency
man gave us a good description of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His superior nodded thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Prescott impersonated Cyril Jernyngham before his
supposed death, and Wandle personated him afterward;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
the latter with the more obvious motive. The point is
that there&#8217;s no evidence of collusion, but rather disagreement,
between the two. Of course, we could arrest
Wandle now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. As soon as the agent identified him, we
could prove forgery and falsification of the land sale record.
He&#8217;d be safe in the guard-room or a penitentiary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so; we will have him there sooner or later, but
if he&#8217;s guilty of the more serious charge, he&#8217;d have no
opportunity for giving himself away. I&#8217;d rather he was
left at large and you kept your eye on him. The same
applies to Prescott. Now I&#8217;ve been making a fresh study
of the diagram of the footsteps near the muskeg, and I can
see no fault in the conclusions you arrived at&mdash;only the remains
can&#8217;t be found.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, that&#8217;s a weak point, sir. But I might mention
the case of the person who was found in a bluff a few
miles from home after they&#8217;d searched the district for
six months.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been in my mind. But you have other matters
to report on. What about the disturbance on the Indian
reservation?&#8221;
</p>
<p>While they discussed it, Jernyngham set out for the
Leslie homestead and on his arrival found Gertrude
alone. Sitting down with a shiver, he looked at her
dejectedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have failed again. They will do nothing; there&#8217;s no
satisfaction to be had,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I drove out my son by
arbitrary harshness, and now the only reparation I might
have made is denied me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were harsh,&#8221; assented Gertrude. &#8220;I have
begun to realize it since we came to Canada&mdash;one sees
things differently here. But, in a sense, I think you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
were not to be blamed; you acted in the belief that you
were right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had seldom ventured to address him with so much
candor and she was surprised at his calmness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it is some relief to remember that;
but I was wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then shouldn&#8217;t it make you more careful not to fall
into a similar error again? You have a fixed idea in
your mind and the way you dwell on it is breaking you
down; seeing you suffer is wearing me. Can&#8217;t you
believe that there is room for doubt?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could,&#8221; he said with some gentleness, recognizing
the anxious appeal in her voice. &#8220;But I
imagined you were as convinced as I am of Prescott&#8217;s
guilt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she replied miserably, &#8220;I believed I was; but
I don&#8217;t know what to think!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He noticed the distress in her face with uncomprehending
sympathy. He was fond of her, in his stern, reserved
fashion, and knew she must deeply feel the loss of
her brother.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as he saw he was suspected, Prescott ran
away,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;That must count against him.
If he had had any motive except the wish to escape, he
would have mentioned it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude sat silent, tormented by confused emotions.
Prescott had told her he was going to hunt for Cyril, and
until she had seen his devotion to Muriel she had felt
that she must believe in him; then her mind had been
filled with jealousy and doubt. She thought she hated
him; after all, he might be guilty. It was not her part to
speak in his defense; though she felt she was acting
treacherously, she could not stand up for him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible that the police were wrong about
Cyril,&#8221; she said at length.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not,&#8221; said Jernyngham. &#8220;It might be
urged that Prescott has come back; but I believe that
was only to sell his wheat.&#8221; He broke into a harsh
laugh. &#8220;One must admit that the fellow has courage;
but he won&#8217;t find it easy to escape again. Every move
of his will be watched.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude sat very still for a few moments, her lips
tightly pressed together. Then she made a gesture of
weariness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s all so hard to bear! There&#8217;s
nothing but doubt and suspense; not a ray of comfort!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Getting up languidly she went out and left her father
lost in thought.
</p>
<p>An hour or two afterward, Prescott sat near the stove
in his homestead, moodily making entries in an account-book,
when he heard voices in the passage and looked up
with a start. The next moment the door opened and
Muriel Hurst came in. His heart throbbed furiously
at the sight of her; she looked excited and eager; her rich
furs enhanced her charm. He thought she made a wonderfully
attractive picture in the small, simply furnished room,
but he laid a strong restraint upon himself as he rose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt that I had to come; I wanted to show that your
friends still trusted you,&#8221; she said impulsively.
</p>
<p>He made no move to bring her a chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a generous thought, but, considering everything,
I don&#8217;t know that it was wise. Did you tell Colston
or your sister that you were coming?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered with a trace of confusion; &#8220;I left
rather in a hurry.&#8221; Then she broke into a forced laugh.
&#8220;This isn&#8217;t the welcome I expected!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>Prescott&#8217;s eyes gleamed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I&#8217;m glad to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, sitting down with a hint of defiance
in her air, &#8220;that&#8217;s the most important thing; though the
confession had to be extorted from you. It looked as if
you wanted to get rid of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt I ought to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel looked at him with amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Duty against inclination! It&#8217;s a pity the former was
beaten. But aren&#8217;t you falling into our way of thinking
rather fast?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t strange. I&#8217;ve had English ideas impressed
on me pretty forcibly during the last few months. But
you made a statement that surprised me. Does Colston
trust me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That implies a doubt. And your sister; is she on my
side?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s reserving her opinion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t say that the Jernynghams are convinced
of my innocence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Muriel. &#8220;I think they&#8217;re cruelly and unreasonably
bitter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that leaves only one person with unshaken
faith.&#8221; His eyes rested on the girl with deep gratitude
and tenderness. &#8220;Miss Hurst, I think I may say it&#8217;s
quite enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked up fearlessly, with heightened color.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t pay each other compliments. Will you
tell me why you went away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I went to look for Cyril Jernyngham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel made an abrupt movement and her eyes
sparkled with relief which she did not try to hide.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that&#8217;s such a complete explanation;
it answers everything! But why didn&#8217;t you tell people
the reason you were going? You must have known
that stealing away, as you did, would count against
you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told Miss Jernyngham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gertrude knew?&#8221; Muriel started. Then her face
hardened. &#8220;After all, that doesn&#8217;t matter; there are
much more important things. You didn&#8217;t find Cyril?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I followed him across three provinces and lost him
in the end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she said. &#8220;How unfortunate, how terribly
disappointing! But tell me all you did; I&#8217;m not asking
from mere curiosity.&#8221; She hesitated. &#8220;I think you
owe me that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He told her the story of his wanderings and what he
had learned about Kermode&#8217;s adventures. She listened
with eager attention, and laughed now and then.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s convincing on the face of it,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;One feels that everything is exactly what Cyril Jernyngham
must have done. Will you tell his father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Prescott answered gravely. &#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t believe
the tale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I feel it can&#8217;t be doubted, after what I have
heard of Cyril&#8217;s character and his conduct in England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have an open mind. I think you hate injustice;
you try to be fair. That, I guess, is why you came to see
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel glanced at him sharply, and then smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it was; I felt that you have been badly
treated. But I only meant to stay a minute or two, and
you seem to be busy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not deny it. Conscious as he was of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
charm and his longing for her, he feared to detain her
lest he should be driven into some rash avowal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very grateful for your confidence,&#8221; he answered
slowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Muriel, &#8220;I must go.&#8221; She rose, but
stood still a moment. &#8220;Mr. Prescott, it hurts me to see
suspicion fall on my friends. You must clear yourself
somehow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said moodily, &#8220;how am I to set about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For one thing, you must not go away again. That
would look bad.&#8221; She hesitated. &#8220;And, from a few
words I heard, I fear it would bring the police after you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems very probable; I&#8217;ll stay while I&#8217;m allowed,&#8221;
he said with some bitterness and turned toward the door
with her. Then a little color crept into his face as she
held out her hand. &#8220;Miss Hurst,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you are a
very staunch friend.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It really looks as if staunchness were one of my virtues;
but you see I venture to act on my opinions without paying
much attention to what other people think. After
all, that would be foolish, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she got into the sleigh and left him wondering
what she could have meant. He knew her friends regarded
him as a man of inferior station, who, if cleared
from suspicion, might perhaps be tolerated so long as he
recognized his limitations and did not presume. Had
Muriel wished to hint that she differed from them in this
respect? The thought of it set his heart to beating fast
and when he went back to his books he found it singularly
difficult to fix his mind on them.
</p>
<p>Muriel drove rapidly to the Leslie homestead and,
reaching it after dark, joined the others at supper. During
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
the meal, a reference to Jernyngham&#8217;s interview with
the police officer gave her the opportunity she was waiting
for.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When Mr. Prescott went away it told badly against
him, because people didn&#8217;t know what his object was,&#8221;
she said.
</p>
<p>She fixed her eyes on Gertrude, but the latter&#8217;s face was
expressionless as she moved her plate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He went to find Cyril,&#8221; she added.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Colston looked up sharply; her husband started.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If true, it&#8217;s a strong point in his favor,&#8221; Colston
declared.
</p>
<p>Gertrude still made no sign; but her father broke into
an incredulous smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An excellent motive! It&#8217;s a pity he didn&#8217;t mention it
before he went! It would have carried more weight then!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was an awkward silence; and then Muriel said
firmly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, that was why he went away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham looked hard at her and made a gesture
which suggested that the matter would not bear discussion.
Then Colston began to talk to her, and he was glad
when the meal was finished. Muriel waited until she
found Gertrude alone in her room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew Mr. Prescott went to look for your brother,
and yet you would not say a word,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed Gertrude sharply. &#8220;So you have
seen him! You drove over this afternoon&mdash;one might
have expected that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel&#8217;s eyes sparkled, but she answered calmly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I went to see him; but you&#8217;re evading the point.
What reason could you have had for trying to injure an
innocent man?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>Gertrude made an uneasy movement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you taking too much for granted? To begin
with, his innocence is very doubtful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, I think you must have been convinced of it.
That he told you why he was going proves that you were
on friendly terms, which would have been impossible if
you had thought him guilty. What has made you
change?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s voice was stingingly scornful. It looked as
if she suspected something, and Gertrude broke into a
cold smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the man is clever; he has a way of
creeping into one&#8217;s confidence. He appears to have
had no trouble in gaining yours. After all, however, if
my father is right, I have a duty to my brother&#8217;s memory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father is so possessed and carried away by an
idea that one can almost forgive him his injustice and
cruelty. You have not the same excuse!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude turned toward her with a formal manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you have gone far enough. Do you intend to
tell the others what you have said to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; answered Muriel. &#8220;It would serve no purpose.
But I feel that sooner or later you will be sorry for
what you have done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she went out, leaving Gertrude alone with her
reflections.

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>WANDLE TAKES PRECAUTIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>Bright sunshine streamed down upon the glittering
plain, tempering the frost, when Wandle stood outside
his house one morning, wondering how he should
employ himself during the day. He had hauled his wheat
in to the elevators, and when that is done the western
farmer has now and then some leisure, because the frozen
ground renders many of his usual operations impossible.
Wandle had a stack of cordwood ready cut, and though he
needed some logs for an addition to his stable which he
meant to build, the thinness of the snow, which had been
disturbed by a strong wind, would make the work of hauling
them home too difficult. He was, however, an active
man, who rarely wasted time or money; and as he looked
about, the ash-heap caught his eye. It was rather large
and near his house, and he determined to remove it, now
that he had nothing better to do.
</p>
<p>In a few minutes he was hard at work with a pick, and
succeeded, with some difficulty, in breaking through the
frozen crust. The moisture, however, had not penetrated
far enough into the fine wood-ash for the rest to freeze, so
that he was soon able to use the shovel and during the
next half-hour he flung a quantity of the stuff into his
wagon. As he did so he looked out for Jernyngham&#8217;s
cash-box, and grew surprised when it did not appear.
When he had hauled the load away and deposited it in
a swampy place he was getting anxious. The box could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
not have escaped his notice, because he had spread the
ash thinly; he had, he thought, dug far enough into the
pile to have reached it; but there was still no sign of it.
This was disconcerting, and he worked until he had
largely reduced the heap, and he scattered the next
load so that every bit of rubbish among it could be seen.
Then he stopped in dismay to think. He had certainly
thrown the box among the ash, and it was gone; the only
inference was that somebody had afterward dug it up
and taken it away.
</p>
<p>Wandle realized this with a shock, but he was too keen-witted
to give way to alarm and leave his task unfinished.
He must remove the whole pile, in order to give no cause
for suspicion that he had been excavating in search of
something; and the sooner it was done the better. It was
noon when the work was finished and he entered the house,
where there was something else to be done. He was a
methodical man and had a place for each of his belongings.
He began by examining the position of every article in a
cupboard. None seemed to have been disturbed, which
was reassuring, and Wandle proceeded to empty a chest
in which he kept his clothing. He had reached the bottom
of it when a pair of light summer shoes caught his eye and
his face became intent. They were not where he had
placed them; he remembered having fitted them in
between some other things at the opposite end of the chest.
This confirmed his worst suspicions, but he carefully
laid back each garment before he sat down to consider.
</p>
<p>It was obvious that the police had searched his house,
and had taken the cash-box away, but he was careful not
to let his fears overcome his judgment. The box was of
a cheap and common pattern; it would be difficult to
identify it as having belonged to Jernyngham. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
more troubled by the evidence that he was being watched
by the police because it might result in their discovering
the sale of land he had made. This must be guarded
against, as the offense was serious, and would, moreover,
connect him with Jernyngham&#8217;s disappearance; but
Wandle would not be driven into any rash and precipitate
action by his alarm. He was a cool, ready-witted,
avaricious man, who had found industry profitable, and
he had no intention of leaving the farm he had spent so
much work on. Flight would mean ruin: he could not
dispose of his property before he went without attracting
attention, and it would, in all probability, lead to his
arrest. He must stay and face the matter out.
</p>
<p>First of all, he tried to estimate the risk of his being
recognized as the man who had sold Jernyngham&#8217;s land.
If the suspicions of the agent he had dealt with were
aroused, he might describe his customer to the police.
Wandle was glad his appearance was by no means striking.
When he sold the land, he had, however, worn a
newly made suit of a rather vivid brown, which the man
would probably remember. Wandle had bought it on
a business visit to Brandon, which was a long way off,
and the police could not have seen it when searching his
house, because they had done so in his absence and when
he left the farm to drive in to the settlement he had put on
the clothes. There was a risk that somebody in Sebastian
might remember how he was dressed, but, as he had been
there only once or twice in the past few months, he did
not think it was likely.
</p>
<p>The garments would have to be sacrificed, which was
unfortunate, because clothing is dear in western Canada;
but Wandle thought of a better means of getting rid of
them, than destroying them. It was obvious that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
suspicions of the police must fall on himself or Prescott,
and he preferred that the latter should be implicated.
After a while, he saw what could be done, provided there
was wind enough to obliterate his footsteps in the snow
or there should be another fall.
</p>
<p>He had to wait a few days; and then one evening he
made up the clothes into a bundle, saddled a horse, and
rode off across the prairie toward the Prescott homestead.
It was very cold and he would have been more comfortable
wrapped in a driving-robe in his buggy; but the moon now
and then shone through the rifts in the clouds, and a rig
could not be hidden or driven in among thick trees.
</p>
<p>A long bluff ran close up to the homestead, and when
Wandle reached its outer end he got down and walked
beside his horse, keeping the wood between him and the
farm trail. It was important that he should not be seen.
The horse would attract no attention, because Prescott
had a number, and hardy, range-bred horses are often
left to run loose through the winter. Still, clear moonlight
streamed through between the slender trees, and there
was a glow from the windows of the house. As Wandle
drew nearer it he moved with greater caution. He was
fortunate in having done so, for he stopped with a start
as two black mounted figures cut against the sky not far
in front of him. They were clearly visible as they crossed
an opening, and though he stood in shadow beside a
denser growth of trees his heart beat faster as he watched
them. They were riding slowly, keeping out of view of
the house, which was significant, because had they been
neighbors of Prescott&#8217;s returning from a visit to him they
would have taken no trouble to avoid being seen. These
were police troopers, watching the homestead.
</p>
<p>Presently one of them spoke to the other, and Wandle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
recognized Private Stanton&#8217;s voice. Indeed, it was ominously
distinct, and Wandle, standing very still with a firm
hand on the bridle, passed a few anxious moments; a movement
of his horse might betray him. The troopers, however,
drew abreast without glancing toward him and the
tension slackened as they slowly moved away. What
they expected to find he could not tell, but he was on the
whole pleased to see them hanging round the bluff. He
waited a while after the faint sound they had made died
away; and then, tying his horse to a branch, he crept
quietly into the bluff.
</p>
<p>There were belts of shadow among the trees; he got
entangled among nut bushes and thickets, but creeping
on toward the house, he reached a more open space and
found a hollow nearly filled with withered leaves. There
he stopped, wondering whether it would be safe to strike
a match; but he knew that something must be risked
and he got a light and bent down, shielding it with his
hands. The leaves lay thickly together, a foot or two in
depth, and the place looked suitable for his purpose.
</p>
<p>A stream of light suddenly broke out from the door of
the homestead and Wandle&#8217;s hand closed quickly on
the match; somebody was crossing from the house to the
stable with a lantern. He could see the man&#8217;s dark
figure plainly, though he could not recognize him, and
he waited until a door was noisily opened. Then he
scraped the leaves aside and laid the brown clothes in the
hollow. He stayed beside it until the man with the
lantern returned to the house, and then he crept back
through the bluff and led his horse toward its end, where
he mounted and rode to the next farm. After spending
an hour with its owner, arranging for a journey to a
bluff where unusually large logs could be found, he rode
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
home content. Everything had gone as he wished;
there would, he thought, be snow enough before morning
to cover any tracks he had left, and he could, if necessary,
account for his having been in the neighborhood of the
Prescott farm.
</p>
<p>During the next week, Wandle watched the weather,
which continued fine after a few snow showers. A
heavy fall might hide the clothes until spring, but he
could think of no means of leading up to their discovery.
To give the police a hint would fix their suspicions on himself,
and he wondered how one could be conveyed to them
indirectly. Chance provided him with an opportunity.
</p>
<p>Gertrude Jernyngham borrowed Leslie&#8217;s team one
afternoon and set out for a drive. Troubled as she was,
she had of late found the strain of maintaining a tranquil
demeanor before her friends growing too much for her,
and it was trying to spend the greater portion of her
time in Muriel&#8217;s society. She was filled with a jealous
hatred of the girl, and felt that it would be a relief to
be alone a while. The air was still, bright sunshine
flooded the plain, the thick driving-robe kept her comfortably
warm; and, lost in painful thought, she had
driven farther than she intended when she turned back.
On doing so, she noticed that she had left the beaten
trail and she looked about timidly. The sun was low,
a gray dimness had crept across the eastern half of the
prairie where the homestead lay and a piercing wind was
springing up. There was nobody in sight and no sign
of a house, and she could not remember which of the
bluffs that stretched in wavy lines across the waste she
had passed.
</p>
<p>She drove on toward the east, eagerly looking for the
trail, while the horse broke through the thin snow-crust
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
and the sleigh ran heavily, until she reached a slope
leading to a frozen swamp. It was of some extent, and
she grew anxious, for she had not seen the spot before.
The country ahead was more broken, rolling in low
rises with short pines on their summits, and it was with
unfeigned satisfaction that she saw a man crossing one
of the ridges. He answered when she called and in a
few minutes she stopped close beside him. He was a
tall man, wearing an old fur coat and dilapidated fur
cap; a rancher, she thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me where Leslie&#8217;s house is?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Wandle, pointing toward the east. &#8220;But
as it will be dark before you get there, you had better let
me put you on the trail. You&#8217;ll have to cross these
sandhills, and as the snow&#8217;s blown off in places, it&#8217;s
rough traveling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude thanked him, and she was glad that he led
the team as they crossed the broken belt, picking out
the smoothest course among the clumps of birches and
low steep ridges. At times he had difficulty in urging
the horses up a bank of frozen sand, but after a while he
looked around at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Miss Jernyngham?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Guess you
must have had a mighty trying time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His tone was respectful and, though he was a stranger,
Gertrude could not resent the allusion to her troubles.
She had generally found the western ranchers blunt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;my father and I have had much
to bear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wandle made a gesture of sympathy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The mystery&#8217;s the worst&mdash;it&#8217;s easier to face a trouble
one knows all about. What have the police been doing
lately?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; they have told us nothing for some
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You find them kind of disappointing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe my father does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man said nothing for a while, and then looked
around again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he ventured, &#8220;it strikes me there&#8217;s one man
Curtis ought to keep his eye on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude started and Wandle studied her face. He
was observant and quick to draw a conclusion, and he
read something that surprised him in her eyes. It
was, he thought, a deeper feeling than suspicion; Miss
Jernyngham knew whom he meant and had some reason
for being very bitter against Prescott.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All I&#8217;ve heard looks black against him,&#8221; he answered
with an air of reflection. &#8220;What does your father
think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is perplexed and distressed,&#8221; said Gertrude
coldly, deciding that the man must not be allowed to go
too far.
</p>
<p>Wandle guessed her thoughts, but he was not to be
daunted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s natural. He must be anxious to learn the
truth, and the police haven&#8217;t found out much yet&mdash;looks
as if they were getting tired.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude hesitated, while he led the horses round a
clump of birches. It was painful and undignified to
discuss the matter with a stranger, but his manner was
suggestive; she felt that he had something to tell. Perhaps
it was her duty to encourage him, and her suspicions
of Prescott drove her on. Wandle waited, knowing
that she would speak.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything that might be useful they have
neglected doing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to say. I&#8217;ll allow that they&#8217;ve worked
through the muskeg and the bluffs pretty thoroughly;
but do you know if they&#8217;ve made a good search round
Prescott&#8217;s house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Gertrude eagerly; &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you that.
But why should they look there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wandle considered. It would be awkward if she
mentioned that she had had a hint from him, but he did
not think this would happen. There was a greater probability
of her acting as if the idea had originated with
her. He let the team stop and looked at her impressively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It strikes me as quite a likely place. I&#8217;ve heard of
people hiding things they wanted to get rid of in a bluff.
You put it to your father and see how the notion strikes
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll think of it,&#8221; Gertrude replied coldly; but Wandle
knew that she would do as he had suggested.
</p>
<p>He said nothing further until they had crossed another
rise or two, when he stopped and pointed to a bluff not
far away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When you make those trees you&#8217;ll strike the trail
and it&#8217;s pretty well beaten. It will take you straight in
to Leslie&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude thanked him and drove on. It was getting
dark, and a bitter wind swept the waste, but at first she
was scarcely conscious of the cold, for her thoughts were
busy. She felt that she had done wrong in allowing the
man to make the suggestion. Somehow it seemed to
involve her in a plot against Prescott; but of late she had
tried to convince herself of his guilt. After all, it was
her duty to have the fullest investigation made and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
fellow had spoken in a significant manner. One could
imagine that he knew more than he had said.
</p>
<p>Darkness closed in on the empty plain, the wind stung
her face, the loneliness grew intense, and she began to
shiver in a mood of black depression. The mystery of
her brother&#8217;s disappearance filled her with keen anxiety;
now she could no longer believe Prescott&#8217;s assurance
that he was not dead. A little while ago she had trusted
him and her cold nature had suddenly expanded in the
warmth of love, but the transforming glow had suddenly
died out, leaving her crushed, humiliated, and very
bitter. Even if her fears about Cyril proved unfounded,
she had nothing to look forward to except a life that had
grown meaningless and dreary; the brief passion she
had yielded to would never be stirred again. She was
growing hard and cruel; her keenest desire was to punish
the man who had, as she thought of it, deceived her.
</p>
<p>At length a light began to blink in the gloom ahead
and soon afterward she got down at the homestead,
feeling very cramped and cold; but an hour or two
passed before she had an opportunity for speaking to her
father alone. It was easy to lead him on to talk of Cyril&#8217;s
disappearance, and by and by she asked if the neighborhood
of Prescott&#8217;s homestead had been searched. He
caught at the idea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to understand why I didn&#8217;t think of that!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;I have lost all confidence in Curtis. What he is
doing, or if he means to let the matter drop, I don&#8217;t know;
but if Prescott has hidden anything that might tell against
him, it will of course be in the bluff! I&#8217;ll go over and examine
every hollow among the bushes, without the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His expression grew eager and Gertrude, knowing that
she had said enough, left him quietly.

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>JERNYNGHAM MAKES A DISCOVERY</h3>
</div>

<p>A piercing wind swept the lonely waste when
Jernyngham left the homestead in the afternoon.
He went on foot, because it was no great distance to the
Prescott farm, and he had no wish to attract notice by
driving up in the sleigh. It was his intention to enter
the bluff quietly a little while before it got dark and,
after searching it, to walk home. By doing so he would
run less risk of being seen, for it was undesirable that he
should put Prescott on his guard. He had said nothing
about his plan to any one except Gertrude, which was
unfortunate, because Leslie, who could read the signs
of the weather, would have dissuaded him.
</p>
<p>Jernyngham felt uneasy as he glanced across the plain.
There was something unusual in the light: every clump
of scrub and bush in the foreground stood out with a
curious hard distinctness, though the distance was
blurred and dim. There was no horizon; the bluffs a
few miles off had faded into a hazy shapelessness. The
sky was uniformly gray, except in the north, where it
darkened to a deep leaden color; the cold struck through
the man like a knife. He was, however, not to be
deterred; snow was coming and a heavy fall might
make an effective search impossible for the remainder of
the winter. There was something inexorable in his
nature; his views were narrow, but he was true to them
and ruled himself and his dependents in accordance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
with a few fixed principles. This was why he had
driven out his son, and was now with the same grim consistency
bent on avenging him. He had a duty and
he meant to discharge it, in spite of raging blizzard or
biting frost. Indeed, if need be, he was willing to lay
down the dreary life which had of late grown valueless
to him. Yet he was not without tenderness, and as he
plodded on over the frozen snow, he thought of the lost
outcast with wistful regret.
</p>
<p>He reached the bluff, and stopped a few moments,
slightly breathless, among the first of the trees. They
were small and their branches cut in sharp, intricate
tracery against the sky; farther back, the rows of slender
trunks ran together in a hazy mass, though they failed
to keep out the wind, and once or twice a fine flake
touched the old man&#8217;s face with a cold that stung. He
pulled his fur cap lower down and set about the search.
For half an hour he scrambled among thick nut bushes,
kicking aside the snow beneath them here and there;
and then he plunged knee-deep into the withered grass
where a sloo had dried. The snow was thin in the wood,
but it hid the iron-hard ground so that he could not tell
if it had been disturbed. It was obvious that the chances
were against his discovering anything, but he persevered,
working steadily nearer to the homestead, of which he
once or twice caught a glimpse where the trees were
thinner.
</p>
<p>At length he stopped suddenly and cast a quick glance
around. He had heard a sharp crack behind him, but
it was not repeated and there was little to be seen.
While he listened, the wind wailed among the branches
and the sloo grass rustled eerily. The patch of sky
above him was growing darker, and the wood looked,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
inexpressibly dreary; but as the light was going, there
was more reason for his making use of it. Though he
was getting tired, he pushed on; avoiding fallen trunks
and branches where he could, and floundering through
thickets, he came to a small hollow which traversed the
bluff. As it was nearly filled with drifted snow, he
stepped down upon its white surface and, breaking
through, sank above his boots in withered leaves. These,
he thought, would effectively hide anything laid among
them until it rotted and crumbled into their decay. He
followed up the hollow, kicking the snow aside. He
fancied that he heard the snapping sound again; but he
was too eager to feel much curiosity about the cause of
it, and there was nothing to be seen. The light was
dying out rapidly, heavy snow was coming, and he must
make the best use of his time.
</p>
<p>After a while, his foot struck something which did
not yield as the leaves had done, and dropping on his
knees he dragged it out. A thrill of excitement ran
through him as he saw that is was a suit of clothes and
made out in the gathering dusk that their color was brown.
Then, as he rose with grim satisfaction, he saw with a
start two indistinct figures watching him a dozen yards
away. They moved forward, and he recognized the
first of them as Curtis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Jernyngham?&#8221; said the corporal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jernyngham. &#8220;Who did you think it
was?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; returned Curtis dryly, &#8220;we didn&#8217;t expect to
find you. What brought you here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing your work with more success than
seems to have attended your efforts.&#8221; He pointed to
the clothes. &#8220;To my mind, this is conclusive.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>An icy blast that set them shivering went roaring
through the wood, but they were too intent to heed it,
and Curtis picked up one of the garments. He could see
only that it was a jacket, for darkness was closing in
suddenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll allow it&#8217;s kind of suggestive,&#8221; he admitted
guardedly.
</p>
<p>Jernyngham broke into a contemptuous laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How was the man who sold my son&#8217;s land dressed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Smartly, in new clothes. The land agent remembered
that they were a reddish brown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the color of the thing in your hand. There
was more light when I pulled it out of the leaves yonder.
Are you convinced now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly enough to make one think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To think, but not to act! You seem strangely
content with the former! Isn&#8217;t it plain that Prescott
sold the land, and then, remembering that he had worn
a suit of rather unusual color which might help to identify
him, hid it in the bluff? Having other people in the
house, he was, no doubt, afraid to burn the clothes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis folded up the garments and laid them on his
arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it sounds quite probable; but there
are discrepancies. I&#8217;ll take these things along, and I
guess you had better make for the homestead and ask
them to let you in. We&#8217;ll have a lively blizzard down
on us very soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The trees bent above him as he spoke, the wood was
filled with sound, and fine flakes drove past in swirls.
Then, as the wild gust subsided, they heard a galloping
horse going by outside the bluff and Curtis swung
sharply round toward his comrade.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that blamed ranger of yours broken loose!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;Get after him with my horse!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next moment the police had vanished and Jernyngham
was left alone, listening to the crackle of undergrowth,
which was lost in a furious uproar as the wood
was swept by another gust. Then the thrashing trees
were blotted out by a white haze which stung his face
with an intolerable cold and filled his eyes. For a
minute or two he could see nothing, though he was
conscious of a tumult of sound and broken twigs came
raining down upon him; then, lowering his head, he
stumbled forward between blurred trees, ignorant of
where he was going. He struck one or two of the trees
and blundered into thickets, but at last he struggled
out of the wood and stopped for a few moments in
dismay.
</p>
<p>The light had gone; he could scarcely see a yard ahead,
through the thick white cloud that rushed past him.
The wind buffeted him cruelly, threatening to fling him
down; the awful cold dulled his senses. He had not
intended to seek shelter at the homestead&mdash;the idea was
repugnant&mdash;and he hardly thought he meant to do so
now, but, overwhelmed by the blizzard, he could not
stand still and freeze. Struggling heavily forward, he
found himself in the open; all trace of the wood had
vanished; he could not tell where he was heading, but
he must continue moving to keep life in him. He could
no longer reason collectedly. He had not been trained
to physical endurance, and he was getting old; in the
grip of the storm he was helpless. By and by his steps
grew feebler and his breath harder to get. How long
he stumbled on he could not remember; but at length
he was sensible of a faint brightness in the snow ahead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
and he made toward it in a half-dazed fashion. It
seemed to die out, leaving him in a state of dull despair,
but a few moments later something barred his way and
stretching out his mittened hand it fell upon the lapped
boarding of a house. There must be a door, he reasoned,
and he groped along the wall until his hand fell forward
into a shallow recess. Then he knocked savagely.
</p>
<p>There was no response. The gale shrieked about
the building, flinging the snow against it in clouds, and
he realized that any noise he made was not likely to be
heard. He fumbled for a latch, and found a knob
which his numbed fingers failed to turn. Then in a
fury he struck the door again, each blow growing feebler
than the last, until the cold overcame him and he slipped
down into the snow. He could not get up; even the
desire to do so grew fainter, and he sank into oblivion.
</p>
<p>It did not last, however, and the return to consciousness
was agonizing. A strong light shone about him,
though he could see nothing clearly, and he felt as if a
boiling fluid were trying to creep through his half-frozen
limbs; his hands and feet, in particular, tingled beyond
endurance, which, had he known it, was a favorable
sign. Then somebody gave him a hot drink and he
heard voices which he vaguely recognized, though he
could not tell to whom they belonged. A little later, he
was lifted up and carried into a different room, where
somebody laid him down and wrapped clothing about
him. The tingling pain passed away, he felt delightfully
warm, and that was all that he was conscious of as he
sank into heavy slumber.
</p>
<p>It was daylight when he awakened, clear-headed and
comfortable, and recognized the room as the one he had
previously occupied in Prescott&#8217;s house. It was obvious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
that he had slept for twelve or fourteen hours; and
seeing his clothes laid out, dry, upon a chair, he got up
and dressed. Then he went down to the living-room,
where Prescott rose as he came in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look much the worse,&#8221; the rancher said.
&#8220;You had a fortunate escape.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did I get here?&#8221; Jernyngham asked, leaning
on the back of a chair, for he felt shaky still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s more than I can tell. Svendsen found you
outside the door when he tried to get across to the stable.
You couldn&#8217;t have been there long: a few minutes, I
guess, though we didn&#8217;t hear you. Do your feet and
hands feel right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham was glad that his host made no inquiries
as to what had brought him into the neighborhood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I must assure you
that I had no intention of seeking shelter in your
house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I should imagine,&#8221; Prescott answered smiling.
&#8220;However, there ought to be a truce between even the
deadliest enemies where there&#8217;s a blizzard raging and
the temperature&#8217;s forty below. Though I can&#8217;t say
you have treated me well, I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t get frozen,
and if you&#8217;ll sit down, I&#8217;ll tell Mrs. Svendsen to bring
you in some breakfast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With what there is between us, you could hardly
expect me to sit at your table.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a comfortable chair you have your hand on.
Bring it nearer the stove and let&#8217;s try to look at the thing
sensibly,&#8221; Prescott persuaded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll confess that I&#8217;d
have excused your visit, if it could have been avoided,
but as you already owe Svendsen and me something, it
would be rather forcing matters for you to drive away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
hungry. That strikes me as about the limit of wrong-headedness,
particularly as I&#8217;m not suggesting that we
should make friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The elder man was possessed by a fixed idea and his
prejudices were strong, but he was, nevertheless, a judge
of character, and the rancher&#8217;s manner impressed him.
He took the chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I owe my life to you or your hired man. I
find the situation embarrassing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be intolerable, if you were not mistaken
about another point,&#8221; Prescott said calmly. &#8220;Now I
want your attention. I&#8217;m not anxious for your good
opinion&mdash;I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d take it as a gift, after
the way you have persecuted me&mdash;but I&#8217;ve a pity for you
that softens my resentment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham moved abruptly, but Prescott raised his
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me get through! I believe you&#8217;re honest; you&#8217;re
acting from a sense of duty, which is why I tell you that
you&#8217;re tormenting yourself without a cause. I had no
hand in your son&#8217;s disappearance, and it&#8217;s my firm conviction
that he&#8217;s alive now and wandering through
British Columbia with a mineral prospector.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What proof have you of this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None that would satisfy you; nothing but my word,
and I give you that solemnly. Make your own inquires
among my neighbors whether it&#8217;s to be believed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For several moments Jernyngham fixed his eyes on
him, and his suspicions began to melt away. Truth had
rung in Prescott&#8217;s voice and it was stamped on his face;
no man, he thought, could lie and look as this rancher
did. Even the discovery of the brown clothes appeared
less damaging.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s much to be explained,&#8221; he said slowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. It will all come to light some day. And
now, it&#8217;s a bitter morning, the drifts are deep, and the
trail lost in snow; Svendsen will have some trouble in
driving you to Leslie&#8217;s, and you can&#8217;t go without
food.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott called to Mrs. Svendsen, and she presently
brought in breakfast. Jernyngham ate a little before he
got into the buggy and was driven away. He reached
the Leslie homestead greatly disturbed. The painful
mystery was as deep as ever, but he was inclined to
think he had been following a false clue; the man on
whom all his suspicions had centered might be innocent.
It was so seldom that he changed his mind that he felt
lost in a maze of doubt, and in his perplexity he told
Gertrude what he had found and related his conversation
with Prescott. They were alone and she listened
with fixed attention, studiously hiding her feelings behind
an inscrutable expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to think; for perhaps the first time
in my life, I&#8217;m utterly at a loss and need a lead,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Everything we have learned about the man tells against
him, and yet I felt I could not doubt his unsupported
assurance. There was a genuine pride in the way he
referred me to his neighbors for his character for truthfulness
and one must admit that a number of them have
an unshakable belief in him. Then Colston&#8217;s wavering;
and Muriel has shown her confidence in the fellow in a
striking manner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Gertrude sharply. &#8220;You have noticed
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could hardly fail to do so. It is no affair of mine and
perhaps a breach of good manners to mention it, but if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
I were in Colston&#8217;s place, I should feel disturbed about
the way in which his sister-in-law has taken Prescott&#8217;s
part.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason should be obvious. Leaving the man&#8217;s
guilt or innocence out of the question, there is his position;
I needn&#8217;t enlarge on it. Muriel&#8217;s family is an old and
honored one; it would be insufferable that she should
break away from its traditions. Then we know what her
upbringing has been. Could one calmly contemplate her
throwing herself away on a working farmer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had appealed to his daughter&#8217;s strongest prejudices,
which had for a while sunk into abeyance and then sprung
into life again. All that he had said about Muriel applied
with equal force to her. She had yielded to a mad infatuation,
and returning sanity had brought her a crushing
sense of shame. She might have made a costly sacrifice
for the rancher&#8217;s sake, flinging away all she had hitherto
valued; she had sought him, humbled herself to charm
him, and he had never spared a tender thought for her.
Despising herself, her jealous rage and wounded pride
could only be appeased by his punishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Prescott,&#8221; she said coldly, &#8220;is a dangerous man; I
have never met anybody so insinuating and plausible.
When he speaks to you, it&#8217;s very hard to disbelieve him;
his manner&#8217;s convincing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt that,&#8221; said her father with a troubled air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then shouldn&#8217;t it put you on your guard, and make
you test his statements? Is it wise to let them influence
you before they&#8217;re confirmed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was foolish of me to be impressed; but still&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude checked him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;With us suspicion is a duty. Try to think! Cyril
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
had his failings, but you were harsh to him. You showed
him no pity; you drove him out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true,&#8221; admitted Jernyngham in a hoarse voice.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve regretted it deeply.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She knew she had not appealed in vain to her father&#8217;s
grief and she meant to work upon his desire for
retribution.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyril came here and fell into Prescott&#8217;s hands. Instead
of his meeting Colston, the rancher personated him.
He was the last man to see him; he knew where he had
hidden his money; soon afterward he bought a costly
machine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know all this,&#8221; said Jernyngham wearily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There seems to be some danger of your forgetting it!
Let me go on! Prescott took over control of Cyril&#8217;s farm.
He passed himself off for him a second time and sold
land of his; you found the clothes he wore hidden near
his house. Could you have any proofs more conclusive?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham flung her a swift glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You believed him once. You are very bitter now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I have admitted that he is plausible;
he deceived me. Perhaps that has made me more relentless;
but I have lost my brother, and I loved him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her father&#8217;s face grew very stern, and he clenched his
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have lost my son, and I wronged him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then there was silence for a few moments; but Gertrude
knew she had succeeded. Her father had been wavering,
but she had stirred him to passion, and his thoughts
had suddenly returned to the groove they would not leave
again. The fixed idea had once more possessed him; unavailing
sorrow and longing for justice would drive him
on along the course he had chosen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have reminded me of my duty,&#8221; he said with
grim forcefulness. &#8220;I shall not fail in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he got up and left her sitting still, lost in painful
reflection. His motives were honest and blameless; but
she had not this consolation. She tried to find comfort
in the thought that if Prescott were innocent, he had
nothing to fear.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>A NIGHT RIDE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was six o&#8217;clock in the evening. Curtis had just finished
his supper and sat drowsily content in his quarters
at the police post after being out in the frost all day. The
temperature had steadily fallen since morning and the
cold was now intensified by a breeze that drove scattered
clouds across the moon and flung fine snow against the
board walls, but the stove, which glowed a dull red, kept
the room comfortable. A nickeled lamp shed down a
cheerful light, and the tired corporal looked forward to a
long night&#8217;s rest. Private Stanton sat near him, cleaning
a carbine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s curious you have heard nothing from Regina since
you sent up those clothes,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;It looked
pretty bad for Prescott.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Curtis. &#8220;Have you ever seen
him with that suit on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor has anybody else, so far as I can learn. There&#8217;s
another point&mdash;the land agent talked of a tall, stoutish
man. You wouldn&#8217;t call Prescott that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those clothes were &#8217;most as good as new; he might
have only had them on the once,&#8221; Stanton persisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what struck me; I don&#8217;t know how they looked
so good, if they&#8217;d been lying where Jernyngham found
them, since last summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a thing I might have thought of.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have a good deal to learn yet.&#8221; Curtis smiled
tolerantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I found you a photograph of Prescott, and
you were glad to send it along to Regina. What do you
think our bosses are doing about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lying low, like sensible men; the more we find out
about this case, the more puzzling it gets. You think you
have pretty good eyes, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re as good as anybody&#8217;s I&#8217;ve come across yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you searched the bluff several times in daylight
and didn&#8217;t see those clothes. Jernyngham comes along
when it is getting dark and finds them. How do you
account for that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve quit guessing; I&#8217;ll leave the thing to you. Anyhow,
I&#8217;ve had about enough of Jernyngham; talked to
me like a sergeant instructor last time I met him, and
you&#8217;d have felt proud if you&#8217;d seen the way he smiled
when I told him he had better go to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll leave it at that,&#8221; said Curtis. &#8220;The man&#8217;s
making me tired, and he&#8217;s worse than he was a month
ago. Where&#8217;s that Brandon paper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>While Stanton looked for it there was a sound of wheels
and a hail outside, and a stinging draught swept in when
the trooper opened the door. A fur-wrapped man sat in
a wagon holding up an envelope.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For Curtis; come for it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Operator asked
me to bring it along. I&#8217;m &#8217;most too cold to get down
and I can&#8217;t let the team stand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The envelope slipped from his numbed fingers as
Stanton tried to take it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dropped near the wheel. My hand&#8217;s &#8217;most frozen,
though I&#8217;ve good thick mittens on. It&#8217;s about the coldest
night I&#8217;ve been out in.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>He drove on, and Stanton hurried in and flung the
door to before he handed the telegram to Curtis.
</p>
<p>When the corporal opened it his face grew intent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from Sergeant Crane,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Glover was
seen this morning near Norton, heading east on the
Sand Belt trail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stanton&#8217;s face fell. He had been in the saddle the
greater part of the day, and the prospect of spending the
night in pursuit of Glover did not appeal to him, though
he knew it could not be avoided. The man was a notorious
thief, whose last exploit had shown some ingenuity.
Appearing at the house of a prosperous farmer, he had
shown him a letter from a railroad contractor asking for the
use of his best Clydesdale team on tempting terms. The
farmer let the horses go and saw no more of them, while
the contractor repudiated the letter. Glover was also
supposed to have had a hand in one or two more serious
affairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll have to get after him,&#8221; said the trooper.
&#8220;Where&#8217;ll he make for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jepson&#8217;s, sure. I don&#8217;t know another house near
the Sand Belt he could reach to-night, and Jepson&#8217;s most
as slippery a tough as Glover is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mighty long ride,&#8221; said Stanton, &#8220;My ranger
will stand for it; I don&#8217;t know about your gray.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have to make it,&#8221; Curtis answered shortly.
&#8220;Get your saddle on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Stanton went out Curtis stood up regretfully, for
he was aching from a long journey in the stinging cold
and the room looked very comfortable. An effort was
required to leave it, and he had not much expectation
of making a capture that would stand to his credit.
Jepson and his brother were cunning rogues; Glover had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
escaped once or twice already, and Curtis realized that
the chances were in favor of his returning after a fruitless
ride. Nevertheless, his duty was plain; he had been
trained to disregard fatigue and most physical weaknesses,
and he went out resignedly into the arctic frost.
</p>
<p>They set off a few minutes later, and Curtis had the
depressing feeling that he was riding a worn-out mount,
though there was some consolation in the thought that the
range of the service carbine might, in case of necessity,
make up for his lack of speed. When he met the biting
north wind that swept the plain the warmth seemed to
leave his body; his mittened hands stiffened on the bridle,
and it was only resolution that kept him in the saddle.
He would run less risk of frost-bite if he walked, but time
would not permit this and the claims of the service are
more important than the loss of a trooper&#8217;s feet or hands.
If he were crippled and incapacitated, there was a small
pension; it was his business to face the risks of the weather.
</p>
<p>They rode on with lowered heads, fine snow stinging
their faces now and then, and though its touch was
inexpressibly painful they were glad they retained the
power of feeling. When that went, more serious trouble
would begin. For a while a half moon shone down, and
their black shadows sped on before them across the
glittering plain, but by and by clouds drove up and the
prairie grew dim. It changed to a stretch of soft grayish-blue,
with the trail they followed running across it a
narrow stretch of darker color. The light, however, was
not wholly obscured; they could see a bluff stand out, a
bank of shadow, a mile away. Once they saw the cheerful
lights of a farm in the distance and a longing for
warmth and the company of their fellow-creatures seized
them, but this was a desire that must be subdued, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
leaving the beaten trail they pressed on into the waste.
Save for the faint, doleful sound the wind made it was
dauntingly silent and desolate. There was not a bush
to break its gray surface, and the frost was intense.
They bore it uncomplainingly for an hour or two, and
then Stanton broke out:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to get down or I&#8217;ll lose my foot! I&#8217;ll run
a while beside my horse and then catch you up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis nodded and trotted on, breasting the wind
which, so far as he could judge from his sensations, was
turning him into ice. He could hear Stanton behind
him, but that was the only sound of life in the vast desolation.
After a while the trooper came up at a gallop,
and Curtis called to him sharply:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any better?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No feeling in my foot yet,&#8221; said Stanton. &#8220;I&#8217;m
anxious about it, but I couldn&#8217;t drop too far behind
you. We have no time to lose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; Curtis answered. &#8220;Glover will pull
out from Jepson&#8217;s long before morning. He won&#8217;t rest
much until he&#8217;s a day&#8217;s ride from the nearest post.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went on, and some time later the moon shone
through again, flooding the plain with light. It was
welcome because they were now entering the Sand Belt
where scrub trees were scattered among little hills.
Pushing through it, they came to a taller ridge late at
night, and Curtis drew bridle on its summit. A faint,
warm gleam appeared on the snow about a mile away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jepson&#8217;s,&#8221; said Curtis. &#8220;Looks as if he had some
reason for sitting up quite a while after he ought to
be in bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stanton glanced thoughtfully down the slope in front.
It was smooth and unbroken, a long, gradual descent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
and he knew the farm stood on the flat at its foot. A
straggling poplar bluff grew close up to the back of the
buildings, but there was nothing that would cover the
approach of the police, and he had no doubt that a
watch was being kept.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity the moon&#8217;s so bright,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a cloud or two driving up, but I don&#8217;t know
that they&#8217;ll cover it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t wait. This is my notion&mdash;you&#8217;ll turn back
a piece and work down to the ravine that runs east
behind the homestead. Stop when you can find cover
and watch out well. I&#8217;ll have to ride straight in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to be careful. There&#8217;ll be three of them
in the place, counting Glover, and they&#8217;re a tough crowd.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jepson has a pretty long head. He&#8217;ll bluff, if he can,
but he won&#8217;t get himself into trouble for his partner.
The thing&#8217;s not serious enough for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, you want to keep your eye on them,&#8221;
Stanton persisted. &#8220;Glover&#8217;ll sure make for the ravine
if he breaks out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Turning his horse, he disappeared behind the ridge,
while Curtis rode on toward the farm. Glancing up at
the moon, he saw that the clouds were nearer it, though
he could not be certain that they would obscure the
light. This was unfortunate, because he knew that he
and his horse would stand out sharply against the
smooth expanse of snow. The light ahead grew brighter
as he trotted on, urging his jaded mount in order to give
the inmates of the homestead as short a warning as
possible. Suddenly another patch of brightness appeared.
It was a narrow streak at first, but it widened into an
oblong and then went out. Somebody had opened the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
door of the homestead, and the next moment the first
gleam faded and all was dark. Curtis was inclined to
think this a mistake on Jepson&#8217;s part, but he kept a
very keen watch as the buildings grew into plainer
shape against the shadowy bluff. He knew he must
have been visible some minutes earlier.
</p>
<p>At length he rode up to the little square house, which
rose abruptly from the plain without fence or yard.
It was dark and silent, and he was glad to remember that
it had only one door, though there were one or two
buildings close behind it. He was so numbed that it was
difficult to dismount, but he got down clumsily and beat
on the door for several minutes without getting an answer.
This confirmed his suspicions, for he was convinced that
Jepson had heard his vigorous knocking. Then the
moonlight, which might have been useful now, died
away, and the plain faded into obscurity. Curtis was
making another attack on the door when a window above
was flung up and a man leaned out, holding what looked
suggestively like a rifle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand back from that door!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What in
thunder do you want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop your gun!&#8221; said Curtis. &#8220;Come down right
now and let me in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess not! If you don&#8217;t light out of this mighty
quick, you&#8217;ll get hurt!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit fooling, Jepson! You know who I am!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seem to know your voice now,&#8221; said the other, leaning
farther out. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Curtis!&#8221; He laid down the
rifle and laughed. &#8220;You were near getting plugged.
Figured you were one of those blamed rustlers&mdash;the country&#8217;s
full of them&mdash;Barton back at the muskeg lost a steer
last week. What I want to know is&mdash;why the police don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
get after them? Guess it would be considerably more
useful than walking round the stations with a quirt under
your arm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man was not talkative as a rule, and Curtis surmised
that he wished to delay him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down!&#8221; he said sternly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be along quick as I can,&#8221; the other answered, and
shut the window.
</p>
<p>While he waited, Curtis listened with strained attention.
He was inclined to think that Glover had already left
the house, which must nevertheless be searched, but he
could hear nothing except the dreary wail of wind in the
neighboring bluff. His fingers were so numbed that he
could scarcely hold his carbine, his horse stood wearily
with drooping head, and when a minute or two had passed
Curtis struck the door violently. It opened, and Jepson
stood in the entrance, holding a lamp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All alone?&#8221; he remarked good-humoredly. &#8220;Where&#8217;s
your partner? But come in; it&#8217;s fierce to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then stand out of my way. I&#8217;ve come for Glover.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jepson laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looked as if you were after somebody. He isn&#8217;t
here, but you had better see for yourself. Walk right in;
you&#8217;re welcome to find him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The house contained four small rooms, which had nothing
in them that would hide a man, and in a minute or
two Curtis sprang out of the door and scrambled to his
saddle. He did not think Glover would seek refuge in
any of the outbuildings, and he rode toward the thin bluff
that hid the ravine. The man might have reached the
trees, unseen, by keeping the house between himself and
the slope down which Curtis had come. He had not
left the house long before he heard the sharp drumming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
of a gallop, and drove his horse at the belt of timber. All
had turned out as he had expected. Stanton had headed
off Glover as he slipped away down the ravine, and the
outlaw had broken out to the north, making for a tract
of lonely, bluff-strewn country. He was now between
the corporal and the trooper, and his capture might be
looked for, provided that Curtis&#8217;s mount could bear a
sharp gallop, which was doubtful.
</p>
<p>The sides of the ravine were steep and clothed with
brush, there were fallen logs in the fringing bluff, but
Curtis urged his jaded horse mercilessly toward the timber,
and went through it with rotten branches smashing
under him. Once or twice the beast stumbled, but
it kept its feet, and in a few more moments they reeled
down the declivity. A fall might result in the rider&#8217;s
getting a broken leg and afterward freezing to death, but
Curtis took risks of this nature lightly, and, reaching the
bottom safely, somewhat to his surprise, he struggled up
the opposite ascent.
</p>
<p>From the summit he saw two dark, mounted figures
pressing across the open plain some distance apart. By
riding straight out from the ravine he thought that he
could cut off the leader. His weariness had fallen from
him, the mad drumming of hoofs fired his blood, and as he
burst out of the timber at a gallop the moon came through.
The fugitive seemed to hear him, for he altered his course
a little&mdash;he could not swerve much without approaching
Stanton&mdash;and for a few minutes Curtis shortened the
distance between them. Then his horse began to flag;
it looked as if Glover might escape, after all, though he
must still draw nearer to the trooper before he got away.
</p>
<p>Curtis, roughly calculating speed and distance, pulled
up his horse. Springing from the saddle, he flung himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
down in the snow, and for a few seconds gripped his carbine
tight. Then there was a flash and little spirts of
snow leaped up one after another ahead of the outlaw.
Curtis pressed down the rear sight and fired again; but
Glover was still riding hard, with Stanton dropping behind
him. At the third shot Glover&#8217;s horse went down
in a struggling heap, hiding its rider. A few moments
later the man reappeared, and began to run, but he stopped
as Stanton came down on him at a gallop, and
Curtis got up hastily. Glover made a sign of submission,
and the next minute Stanton sprang to the ground
beside him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold up your hands!&#8221; he ordered sharply, and there
was a clink as the irons snapped to.
</p>
<p>After that the trooper turned to Curtis, who was hurrying
toward them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lend me your carbine; mine&#8217;s clean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He walked to the fallen horse, which was struggling
feebly, and, stooping down he examined it. Then there
was a crash and a puff of smoke, and he rejoined the
corporal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing else that could be done,&#8221; he explained.
</p>
<p>Curtis spoke to the prisoner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along. You had better not try to break
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went back to the homestead where they found
Jepson waiting for them. He looked disturbed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you he wasn&#8217;t here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How was I
to know he was hiding in the ravine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis gave him a searching glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll consider that later. I want your team and
wagon, some blankets, and driving-robes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I bound to outfit the police?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you had better. Your record&#8217;s none too
good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He led his prisoner into the kitchen, where the stove
was burning, and, laying his carbine on the table, he
loosed the handcuffs and bade the man take off his long
coat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go through his pockets, Stanton,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>The trooper did as he was told, but nothing of any
importance was produced. The man was not armed,
and there were only a few silver coins and bills for small
amounts in his possession. Curtis stood wearily, regarding
him with a thoughtful smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get that jacket, Glover?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you generally get such things? At the
store.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said Curtis. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see why you didn&#8217;t
buy one that fitted you.&#8221; He turned suddenly to
Jepson. &#8220;Bring me his jacket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The farmer made an abrupt movement, and then
seemed to pull himself up, and stood still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no use for that kind of fooling; he has it on!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; said Curtis meaningly. &#8220;Give
Stanton a light and he&#8217;ll look for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The trooper came back in a few minutes with a
garment which he had found under a bed, and Curtis
bade him put it on the prisoner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right size, same stuff as the trousers, and worn about
as much,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Now you can take it off and
search it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was nothing in the pockets, but after a careful
examination Stanton felt a lump inside the lining.
He ripped that, and took out a wad of carefully folded
bills. On opening them, he found that they were for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
twenty dollars each, and clean. The corporal&#8217;s face
grew suddenly intent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get them?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can find out!&#8221; muttered Glover, who had
shown signs of dismay.
</p>
<p>Curtis turned to Jepson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if he trusted you farther than I would;
but harness your team quick, and if your brother&#8217;s
hanging round outside, tell him that he&#8217;ll run up against
trouble if he interferes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They sat down and waited until the farmer brought a
wagon to the door, and then they drove away through
the stinging cold with their prisoner.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>MURIEL PROVES OBDURATE</h3>
</div>

<p>Some time after leaving Jepson&#8217;s Curtis was joined
by two police troopers, despatched by the sergeant
who had telegraphed to him. He handed over his prisoner
and the wagon to them, though he asked permission
to keep the wad of bills. Then Stanton unhitched the
jaded horses from the back of the vehicle, and while the
others drove back to the west he and Curtis rode on to
the post. Reaching it, half frozen, in the morning, they
filled up the stove and went to sleep until supper time.
When the meal was over they sat down to smoke and talk.
</p>
<p>Stanton felt lazily good-humored. A sound sleep
had refreshed him, and though his limbs still ached,
he was enjoying the pleasant, physical reaction which
usually succeeds fatigue and exposure to the arctic
frost. What was better, he had assisted in the successful
completion of an arduous piece of work. Curtis lay
back in a chair opposite him, pipe in mouth, his expression
suggesting quiet satisfaction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Toes feeling pretty good?&#8221; he inquired by and by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to say they are, though I thought I was in
for trouble,&#8221; Stanton said with a deprecatory smile.
&#8220;I allow that frost-bite&#8217;s a thing I&#8217;m easy scared about,
after the patrol I made with Stafford through the northern
bush last winter. Got his foot wet with mushy snow
crossing a rapid where the ice was working, and it froze
bad; had to pack him the last two hundred miles on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
sled, with the dogs getting used up, and the grub running
out. They paid him off at Regina and sent him home;
but Stafford will never put on an ordinary boot again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A frozen foot&#8217;s bad enough, if you have to walk
until it galls,&#8221; Curtis admitted. &#8220;A hand&#8217;s easier looked
after, though I&#8217;ve three fingers I&#8217;m never quite sure of.
That&#8217;s one reason it took so much shooting before I
plugged Glover&#8217;s horse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were pretty cute about his jacket,&#8221; Stanton
remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was easy enough. The thing was too big
for him and newer than his trousers. Soon as I noticed it,
I knew I&#8217;d dropped on to something worth following
up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see what you made of it, and you haven&#8217;t
told me yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was too dog-goned cold and tired to talk; wanted
to make the post and get to sleep. However, though
I gave Crane&#8217;s boys no hint, I&#8217;ll show you what I&#8217;ve
been figuring on. Consider yourself a jury and tell me
how it strikes you. You have as much intelligence as
the general run of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t any more than the kind of jurymen
we&#8217;re usually up against, I&#8217;d quit the service,&#8221; Stanton
declared.
</p>
<p>The corporal&#8217;s eyes twinkled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll learn to think and not hustle, you&#8217;ll make a
useful man some day. Anyhow, the first thing I caught
on to was that Glover had taken off his jacket because
there was something in it he didn&#8217;t want us to find.
Next, that it was money or valuables, because he could
have put any small thing into the stove or hid it in the
snow before he lit out. Now, Glover knew it was kind of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
dangerous to leave his jacket with Jepson, who might
find the bills, and as he couldn&#8217;t tell you were in the ravine
he must have thought he had a good chance of getting
clear away; but, for all that, he wouldn&#8217;t risk taking
the wad along. Guess there&#8217;s only one explanation&mdash;he&#8217;d
a reason for being mighty afraid of those bills
falling into our hands. That was plain enough when I
asked him about his jacket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Stanton said thoughtfully; &#8220;I guess you have
got it right. But what was his reason? He knows
Crane can have him sent up for horse-stealing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis, opening a drawer, took out a slip of paper
with some numbers on it, and then laid the wad of bills
on the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty dollars each, Merchants&#8217; Bank, and quite
clean,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a five-dollar bill on the same bank we found
at the muskeg!&#8221; cried Stanton, starting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was.&#8221; Curtis took up the list. &#8220;Now here are
the numbers of the twenty-dollar bills Morant at Sebastian
got from the bank a day or two before he made the
deal with Jernyngham; it was with those bills he paid
him the night he disappeared.&#8221; He paused and added
significantly, &#8220;I guess we have got some of them here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This proved to be correct when they had compared
them with the list. Then Curtis leaned back in his
chair and filled his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mighty curious case,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; replied Stanton. &#8220;You get no farther with
it. You have points against three different men, and
it&#8217;s pretty clear that they haven&#8217;t been working together.
They can&#8217;t all have killed the man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true. Well, I&#8217;ve made a report for Regina,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
and they&#8217;ll keep Glover safe until we want him. I can&#8217;t
tell what our chiefs will do; but as Glover&#8217;s not likely
to tell them anything, I guess they&#8217;ll hold this matter
over until we find out more.&#8221; He locked up the money.
&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll quit talking about it. I want to give my
mind a rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis had few of the qualities needed for the making
of a great detective; he was merely a painstaking,
determined man, with a capacity for earnest work,
which is perhaps more useful than genius in the ranks
of the Northwest Police. He could tirelessly follow
the dog-sleds, sometimes on the scantiest rations, for
hundreds of miles over the snow, sleeping in the open
in the arctic frost. He had made long forced marches
to succor improvident settlers starving far out in the
wilds; in the fierce heat of summer he made his patrols,
watching the progress of the grass-fires, sternly exacting
from the ranchers the plowing of the needed guards;
and cattle-thieves prudently avoided the district that he
ruled with firm benevolence. The man was a worthy
type of his people, the new nation that is rising in the
West: forceful, steadfast, direct, and, as a rule, devoid
of mental subtleties. He admitted that the Jernyngham
mystery, every clue to which broke off as he began to
follow it, was harassing him.
</p>
<p>While he spent the evening, lounging in well-earned
leisure beside the stove, Mrs. Colston was talking
seriously to her sister in a room of the Leslie homestead.
Owing to the number of its inmates, she had found it
difficult to get a word with the girl alone, and now that
an opportunity had come, she felt that she must make
the most of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Muriel,&#8221; she said, &#8220;do you think it&#8217;s judicious to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
speak so strongly in Prescott&#8217;s favor as you have done of
late? You were rude to Gertrude last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl colored. She had, as a matter of fact, lost
her temper, which was generally quick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate injustice!&#8221; she broke out. &#8220;Gertrude and
her father make such an unfair use of everything they
can find against him, and I think Gertrude&#8217;s the worse
of the two.&#8221; She looked hard at her sister. &#8220;She
shows a rancor against the man which even the disappearance
of her brother doesn&#8217;t account for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The same idea had occurred to Mrs. Colston, but it
was a side issue and she was not to be drawn away from
the point.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You stick to the word disappearance,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Muriel answered steadily. &#8220;Cyril Jernyngham
isn&#8217;t dead!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have only Prescott&#8217;s word for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel made no answer for a few moments; then she
looked up with a resolute expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m satisfied with it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her sister understood this as a challenge. She had
indulged in hints and indirect warnings, and they had
been disregarded. The situation now needed more
drastic treatment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is a significant admission; I can&#8217;t
let it pass. Your prejudice in favor of the man has, of
course, been noticeable; you have even let him see it.
Don&#8217;t you realize what damaging conclusions one might
draw from it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Damaging?&#8221; Muriel&#8217;s eyes were fixed on her sister,
though her face was hot. &#8220;As you have been thinking
of all this for some time, perhaps you had better
explain and get it over.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Colston leaned forward with a severe expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that some candor is necessary. You have
taken the man&#8217;s side openly; you have sympathized
with him; I might even say that you have led him on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel&#8217;s wayward temperament drove her to the
verge of an outbreak, but with an effort at self-control,
she sat still, and her sister resumed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides his lying under suspicion, the man is a mere
working farmer, imperfectly educated, forced to live in a
most primitive manner, thinking of nothing but his crops
and horses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not imperfectly educated! As a matter of
fact, he knows more about most things than we do; but
that&#8217;s not important. Mind, I&#8217;m admitting nothing
of all that you suggest, but you might have said that
I&#8217;m a penniless girl, living on your husband&#8217;s charity.
I must confess that he gives it very willingly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is precisely why I&#8217;m anxious about your
future.&#8221; Mrs. Colston&#8217;s voice softened to a tone of
genuine solicitude. &#8220;Of course, we are glad to have
you&mdash;Harry has always been fond of you&mdash;but, for
your sake, I could wish you a completer life in a home
of your own. But so much depends on the choice you
make.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; a very great deal depends on that. I&#8217;m expected,
of course, to make a brilliant match!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not necessarily brilliant, but there are things we have
always enjoyed which must be looked for&mdash;a good name,
position, the right to meet people brought up as we have
been, on an equal footing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel broke in upon her with a strained laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Once, for a little while, it looked as if we should have
to do without them, and somehow I wasn&#8217;t very much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
alarmed. But your list&#8217;s rather short and incomplete.
There are one or two quite as important things you
might have added to it; though perhaps I&#8217;m exacting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was silence for a few moments, and a faint
flicker of color crept into Mrs. Colston&#8217;s face while the
girl mused. Her sister had got all she asked for, but
Muriel suspected that she was not content; now and then,
indeed, she had seen a hint of weariness in her expression.
Harry Colston made a model husband in some respects,
but he had his limitations. His virtues were commonplace
and sometimes tedious; his intelligence was less
than his wife&#8217;s. Muriel was fond of him, but his unwavering
good-nature and placidity irritated her. She was
inclined to be sorry for her sister in some ways.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Muriel,&#8221; Mrs. Colston resumed gently, &#8220;your happiness
means a good deal to me. A mistake might cost you
dear, and, after all, one cannot have everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is obviously true. I suppose it&#8217;s a question of
what one values most, or perhaps what most strongly
appeals to one&#8217;s fancy. It would be difficult to fix an
accurate standard for judging suitors by, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
Then her tone grew scornful. &#8220;Besides, as those who
are eligible aren&#8217;t numerous, a girl&#8217;s expected to wait
with an encouraging smile and thankfully take what
comes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Colston looked at her reproachfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re hardly just, my dear; I only urge you to be
prudent now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Prudence is such a cold-blooded thing! I&#8217;m afraid I
never had it. After all, what seems wise to me might appear
to be folly to you. I think if ever what looks like
a chance of happiness is offered me, I shall take all risks
and clutch at it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>She picked up a book, as if to intimate that she had
no more to say, and Mrs. Colston wondered whether her
worst fears were justified or whether Muriel had been
behaving with unusual perverseness. In either case,
she might make things worse by laboring the subject.
She hesitated a moment and then went out in search of
her husband.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we have been away a long while.
Don&#8217;t you think it is time to go home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;I haven&#8217;t thought so. What
suggested the idea?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was obvious that he had no suspicion of her motive,
and she was not prepared to explain that she wished to
place Muriel beyond Prescott&#8217;s reach.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said lamely, &#8220;aren&#8217;t you rather neglecting
your duties?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Colston replied with a smile; &#8220;as they&#8217;re to a
large extent merely formal ones, I believe they can wait
a little longer without much harm being done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Colston was surprised. She had not expected
such an admission from her husband, though she agreed
with him. Harry was not, as a rule, susceptible to new
impressions, but there was a subtle influence in the simple
life on the prairies which altered one&#8217;s point of view and
led to one&#8217;s forming a new estimate of values. She had
felt this. Things which had seemed essential in England
somehow lost their importance in Canada.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;you will remember that I
made arrangements to be away a year, if necessary, and
perhaps if I make the most of my opportunities in this
country, I may have something worth while to say when
we go home again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was more in his usual vein; but his wife did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
encourage him. Harry was apt to grow tiresome in his
improving mood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t think of staying the full year?&#8221; she
asked in alarm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; we might wait another week or two, or even
a month more. It wouldn&#8217;t be the thing to desert
Jernyngham; and, as we&#8217;re mixed up in it, I feel it would
be better to see the matter through.&#8221; He smiled at his
wife with cumbrous gallantry. &#8220;Then, though you always
look charming, you&#8217;re now unusually fresh and fit;
there&#8217;s no doubt that the place agrees with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Colston could not deny it. She yielded for the
present, deciding to wait until some turn of events rendered
him more amenable. In spite of his good humor,
Harry was obstinate and often hard to move.
</p>
<p>She went to join Gertrude, while Muriel, sitting alone
where she had been left, laid down her book, and let her
eyes range slowly round the room, trying to analyze the
impression it made on her. There was no carpet on the
floor; the walls were made of mill-dressed boards which
had cracked with the dryness and smelt of turpentine.
The furniture consisted of a few bent-hardwood chairs
and a rickety table covered with a gaudy cloth. The
nickeled lamp, which diffused an unpleasant odor, was
of florid but very inartistic design; the plain stove stood
in an ugly iron tray, and its galvanized pipe ran up, unconcealed,
to the ceiling. A black distillate had trickled
down from a bend in it, and stained the floor.
</p>
<p>Muriel realized that had she been expected to live in
such a place in England it would have struck her as comfortless,
and almost squalid; but now, perhaps by contrast
with the frozen desolation without, it looked cheerful,
and had a homelike air. This, she thought, was significant,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
and she followed up the train of ideas to which it
led. She had a practical, independent bent; she liked
to handle and investigate things for herself, to get into
close and intimate touch with life. At home, this had
not often been possible; she was too sheltered and, in a
sense, too secluded. The people she met were conventional,
acting in accordance with a recognized code,
concealing their feelings. If she rode or drove, somebody
got ready the horse for her; it was the same with the car.
When she strolled through an English garden, she might
pluck a flower or take pleasure in the smoothness of the
lawn, but it was always with the feeling that others had
planted and mown. She could take no active part in
things; there was little that she could really do.
</p>
<p>It was different on the Western prairie. Here men and
women showed anger or sorrow or gladness more or less
openly. One could realize their emotions, and this, instead
of deterring, attracted her; one came to close grips
with the primitive influences of human nature. Then
they were strenuous people, toiling stubbornly, rejoicing
in tangible results that their hands and brains had produced.
Woman was man&#8217;s real helpmate, not a companion
for his idle hours. She kept his house, and in
time of pressure drove his horses; she had her say in determining
the count of the cattle and the bushels of seed,
and it was sometimes conceded that her judgment was
the better.
</p>
<p>But this was only one aspect of the subject that filled
the girl&#8217;s thoughts. She knew that Prescott loved her
and she was glad of it; but here she stopped. She was
sanguine, impulsive, courageous, but, with all that could
be said for it, the change she must face if he claimed her
was a startling one. Besides, he must clear himself of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
suspicion, and because the part of a mere looker-on was
uncongenial, there was a course which she would urge
on him. She must see him and convince him of the necessity
for it. Soon after she had made up her mind on this
point, Jernyngham and Colston came in, and she had to
talk to them.

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>A WOMAN&#8217;S INFLUENCE</h3>
</div>

<p>Muriel found it needful to wait several days for an
opportunity for speaking to Prescott. It did not
seem advisable to visit his house again, and she was at a
loss for a means of meeting him when she overheard
Leslie tell his wife that he would ask Prescott, who was
going to Sebastian the next morning, to bring out some
stores they required. The next day Muriel borrowed a
team and, contenting herself with an intimation that she
was going for a long drive, set off for the settlement. It
would be time enough to confess her object if her sister
taxed her with it, and there were one or two purchases
she really wished to make.
</p>
<p>She had never gone so far alone, though she had occasionally
driven to an outlying farm, and the expedition
had in it the zest of adventure. Moreover, she was
boldly going to undertake a very unusual task in showing
Prescott what he ought to do. So far, she had been an
interested spectator of the drama of life, but now she
would participate in it, exercising such powers as she
possessed, and the thought was additionally fascinating
because among her intimate friends she could not pick out
a man who owed much to a woman&#8217;s guidance. Her
sister had some mental gifts, but Harry Colston, disregarding
her in a good-humored but dogged fashion, did what
he thought best; while the idea of Jernyngham&#8217;s deferring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
to Gertrude was frankly ridiculous. Neither man had
much ability; indeed, it was, as a rule, the dullest men
who were most convinced of their superior sense. Prescott
far surpassed them in intellect; but she pulled herself
up. She was not going to dwell on Prescott&#8217;s virtues
unduly, and she had not convinced him yet.
</p>
<p>The team gave her no trouble, the trail was good, and
reaching Sebastian safely, she spent some time in a drygoods
store, and afterward went to the hotel, where supper
was being served. She would not have waited for it, only
that she had seen nothing of Prescott, and she had the
excuse that the team must have a rest. On entering the
big dining-room she was inclined to regret that meals
can rarely be had in private in the West, although, by
the favor of a waitress, she succeeded in obtaining a
small table to herself. There were only two women
present, clerks in the store, she believed, but the room was
nearly filled with men. Among them were ranchers with
faces darkened by the glare of the snow, some of them
wearing shabby coats from which the fur was coming off,
though the room was warm; a few railroad hands who
laid sooty mittens on the table; the smart station-agent;
a number of storekeepers and clerks. Now and then
boisterous laughter rang out, and one group indulged
in rather pointed banter, while the way that several of
them used their knives and forks left much to be desired;
but nobody regarded the girl with marked attention.
For all that, she was sensible of some relief when Prescott
came in and moved toward her table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I take this place?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>After speaking to a waitress, he inquired whether
Colston or her sister were at the hotel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No; I drove in alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She saw his surprise, which suggested that her task
might prove more difficult than she had imagined.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the trail&#8217;s pretty good and there&#8217;s
a moon to-night; but didn&#8217;t you hesitate about getting supper
here by yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very much; there was really no reason why I
should hesitate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true. But you had your doubts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were foolish,&#8221; Muriel told him. &#8220;Why are
you so curious?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m interested.&#8221; He indicated the room and its
occupants. &#8220;These people, their manners, and surroundings
are typical of the New West.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you feel that you ought to defend them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! They don&#8217;t need it. They have their
faults and their virtues, and neither are mean. They&#8217;ve
the makings of a big nation and they&#8217;re doing great
work to-day. However, you had certainly no cause for
uneasiness; there&#8217;s not a man in the place who would
have shown you the least disrespect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; Muriel contended, &#8220;they&#8217;re not your
people. You came from Montreal; your ideas and habits
are more like ours than theirs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re mine by adoption; I&#8217;ve thrown in my lot
with them.&#8221; He fixed his eyes on her. &#8220;Do you know
the secret of making colonization a success? In a way,
it&#8217;s a hard truth, but it&#8217;s this&mdash;there must be no looking
back. The old ties must be cut loose once for all; a man
must think of the land in which he prospers as his home;
it&#8217;s not a square deal to run back with the money he
has made in it. He must grow up with the rising nation
he becomes a member of.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Muriel conceded slowly; &#8220;I think that is so.
But it&#8217;s harder for a woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet have you seen any one who looked unhappy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she admitted with thoughtful candor. &#8220;The
few I have got to know seem to have an importance that
perhaps is not very common at home. For instance, I
heard Leslie giving his wife his reasons for thinking of
buying some Hereford cattle, and his respect for her
opinion impressed me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were going to sell those beasts, I&#8217;d rather make
the deal with her husband.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he changed the subject and they talked in a
lighter vein until the room began to empty and a waitress
came to collect the plates.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they close this place as soon as supper is
finished?&#8221; Muriel asked, trying to overcome her diffidence.
&#8220;Where can I have a word or two with you?
I was afraid that somebody might overhear us here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The parlor would be best,&#8221; he answered in some
surprise. &#8220;The boys prefer the downstairs room and
the bar. I&#8217;ll tell the man about my horse, and then
I&#8217;ll be there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel found the few minutes she had to wait trying,
but she gathered her courage when he joined her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; she said with an air of decision. &#8220;I&#8217;d
better begin at once, and the thing is serious. What
have you done to clear yourself, since I last saw you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His searching glance filled her with misgivings; without
being subtle, he was by no means dull, and he must
be curious about her motive in asking him. To her relief,
however, he confined himself to the point she had raised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. I don&#8217;t see what can be done.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then are you content to remain suspected?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;m not content! But as I seem to be helpless,
the fools who can only judge by appearances and the
others who are quick to think the worst of me must believe
what they like. Anyway, their opinion doesn&#8217;t count for
much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can people judge except by appearances?&#8221;
Muriel argued. &#8220;Besides, do you divide everybody you
know into those two classes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked hard at her and, to her annoyance, she grew
confused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said slowly; &#8220;that would be very wrong&mdash;I
was too quick. There are a few with generous minds
who haven&#8217;t turned against me and I&#8217;m very grateful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have been enough if you had said they had
sense; but don&#8217;t you feel you owe them something? Is
it fair to keep silence and do nothing while they fight your
battle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are there people who are doing so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Muriel answered steadily. &#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t
to doubt it. You&#8217;re wronging your friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His expression betokened a strong effort at self-control.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it seems I have a duty to them, but
how I&#8217;m to get about it is more than I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you thought of telling the police about your
journey to British Columbia and what you learned about
Cyril Jernyngham?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid they wouldn&#8217;t believe me. Then there&#8217;s
the trouble that the man I followed called himself
Kermode.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind. Tell them; tell everybody you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be useless,&#8221; Prescott said doggedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wrong,&#8221; Muriel persisted. &#8220;When a thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
is talked about enough, people begin to believe it.
Besides, it would give your supporters an argument
against the doubtful. I&#8217;m afraid they need one after
the finding of the clothes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The clothes? What clothes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel&#8217;s faith in Prescott had never been shaken, but
his surprise caused her keen satisfaction, and she told
him all she knew about Jernyngham&#8217;s discovery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, I don&#8217;t see what finding them there could
signify,&#8221; he said when she had finished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t know that a day or two after Cyril
Jernyngham disappeared, a man dressed in clothes like
those found, sold some land of his at a place called
Navarino?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott started.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the first I&#8217;ve heard of it. There&#8217;s some villainy
here; the things must have been hidden near my house
with the object of strengthening suspicion against me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course! But you can&#8217;t think that Jernyngham
had a hand in it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! The man is trying to ruin me, but that kind
of meanness isn&#8217;t in his line. Perhaps I&#8217;d better say that
I never had clothes like those and that I sold no land of
Cyril&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Prescott,&#8221; Muriel murmured shyly, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t
necessary to tell me this; I never doubted it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he answered shortly, but there was
trouble in his voice and the girl thought she knew what
his reticence cost.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you will tell other people this and go
to see Corporal Curtis? You agreed that women have
some power here, and, even if you&#8217;re not convinced, you
will do what I ask because I wish it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have my promise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He walked toward the window and stood looking out
for a moment or two before he turned to her again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you had better start for home? The
moon looks hazy. May I drive out with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel had shrunk from the long journey in the dark,
and she readily agreed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell them to bring your team round,&#8221; he said,
moving toward the door. &#8220;Get off as soon as you&#8217;re
ready, and I&#8217;ll come along when I&#8217;ve collected a few
things I bought.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl let him go, appreciating his consideration,
for she guessed his thoughts. He was under suspicion
and would give the tatlers in the town nothing on which
to base conjectures. It hurt her pride, however, to admit
that such precautions had better be taken.
</p>
<p>Leaving the hotel, she found the trail smooth when
she had crossed the track, but after she passed the last
of the fences the waste looked very dreary. The moon
was dimmed by thin, driving clouds, and the deep silence
grew depressing; the loneliness weighed on her, and she
began to listen eagerly for the beat of hoofs. For a time
she heard nothing and she had grown angry with Prescott
for delaying when a measured drumming stole out of the
distance and her feeling of cheerfulness and security
returned. Its significance was not lost on her: she was
learning to depend on the man, to long for his society.
Then, for no obvious reason, she urged the team and
kept ahead for a while. When he came up with an
explanation about a missing package, she laughed half-mockingly,
and on the whole felt glad that the narrowness
of the trail, which compelled him to follow, made conversation
difficult.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>An hour after she left the settlement the moon was
hidden and fine snow began to fall. It grew thicker,
gradually covering the trail, until Muriel had some
difficulty in distinguishing it. The sleigh was running
heavily, and after a while Prescott told her to stop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go ahead, and then you can follow my buggy,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;There won&#8217;t be much snow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel felt that there was quite enough to have made
her very anxious had she been alone, but when he passed
and took his place in front she drove on in confidence.
She remembered that this was not a new feeling. He was
a man who could be trusted; one felt safe with him. Now
and then she could hardly see the buggy and she was glad of
his cheery laugh and the somewhat inconsequent remarks
he flung back to her when the haze of driving flakes
grew thicker. So far as she could see, the trail now
differed in nothing from the rest of the wilderness, but
he held on without hesitation, and she felt no surprise
when once or twice a belt of trees she remembered
loomed up. They made better progress when the snow
ceased, and at length Prescott stopped his horse and she
saw a faint blink of light some distance off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Leslie&#8217;s,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Shall I drive to the
house with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that isn&#8217;t needful, thank you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll wait until I see the door open. I&#8217;ll look
up Curtis in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel turned off toward the farm, where she found
Colston and her sister disturbed by her absence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; Mrs. Colston asked.
&#8220;You have frightened us. Harry would have driven
out to look for you if he had known which way to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to the settlement. I bought the things we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
spoke about, and I met Mr. Prescott, who brought me
home.&#8221; Muriel spoke in a tone that discouraged further
questions. &#8220;Now I&#8217;m very cold, Harry, you might
shake the snow from those furs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She left them soon afterward, pleading fatigue, and
went to sleep, feeling satisfied with what she had done
and knowing that Prescott would keep his promise.
</p>
<p>Her confidence was justified, for on the following day
he drove over to the police post and found Curtis
alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to tell you something and I&#8217;ll ask you
to let me get through before you begin to talk,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Curtis showed no surprise and indicated a chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit there and go ahead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He listened with close attention while Prescott described
his journey and recounted all that he had learned
about Kermode.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me this earlier?&#8221; Curtis asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t imagine that you would believe it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what makes you think I&#8217;ll believe it now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To be honest, I don&#8217;t care whether you do or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis sat silent a few moments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What you have told me amounts to this,&#8221; he then
summed up: &#8220;you have heard of a man who seems to
look like Cyril Jernyngham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as much to the purpose that he acts like him.
I&#8217;ve told you all I learned about his doings and you
can judge for yourself. You knew the man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do you,&#8221; said Curtis pointedly.
</p>
<p>Prescott smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave it at that. I want you to find out whether I&#8217;m
correct or not. You made some inquiries along the new
line?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t go far west,&#8221; Curtis admitted. &#8220;There
were difficulties, and we couldn&#8217;t see much reason for
the search. It was quite clear to me that Jernyngham
was knocked out near the muskeg.&#8221; He looked hard
at Prescott. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t easy to change that opinion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems your duty to test it. Even if the thing costs
some trouble, can&#8217;t you instruct your people in Alberta
to find out whether a man called Kermode worked in
any of the construction camps, and if they&#8217;re satisfied
that he answers Jernyngham&#8217;s description, to have him
followed up in British Columbia?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a point you haven&#8217;t got hold of,&#8221; Curtis
replied. &#8220;When you struck a camp, asking after your
partner, the boys were ready to talk to you; but it&#8217;s quite
different when a trooper comes along. I wouldn&#8217;t have
much use for anything they told him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott realized the truth of this. Traveling on foot
in search of a working comrade, he had been received
by the railroad hands as one of themselves; but he knew
that men with checkered careers which would not bear
investigation found refuge among the toilers on the new
lines, and that even those who had nothing to fear
would consider reticence becoming when questioned by
the police. The only excuse for loquacity would be
the sending of an inquisitive constable on a fruitless
expedition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then can&#8217;t you try the bosses?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess they&#8217;re not likely to have found out much
about the man, and the boys wouldn&#8217;t tell them. However,
I&#8217;ll send up a report and see what can be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Prescott, and then asked bluntly:
&#8220;What do you make of the brown clothes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you heard they were found!&#8221; said Curtis with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
some dryness. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t done figuring on the matter
yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose I&#8217;d help you by saying that they
don&#8217;t belong to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis looked at him thoughtfully but made no answer
for a while. Then:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever see anybody wearing a suit like that?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Prescott answered, &#8220;I believe I once did,
but I can&#8217;t think who it was. I&#8217;ve been trying hard to
remember all day and it may come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He got up and Curtis walked to the door with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Frost&#8217;s keeping pretty keen,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>Prescott drove away, and the corporal was smoking
near the stove when Stanton came in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look as if you&#8217;d been studying the Jernyngham
case,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll allow it&#8217;s enough to get on your
nerves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Prescott&#8217;s been here,&#8221; replied Curtis. &#8220;He&#8217;s heard
those blamed clothes were found, and that&#8217;s going to
make us trouble. We&#8217;ve had Jernyngham interfering
and mussing up the tracks, and now Prescott&#8217;s getting
ready to butt in. I expect he&#8217;ll be off to Navarino very
soon, and we can&#8217;t stop him unless we arrest him, which
I&#8217;m not ready to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he tell you he was going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t needed; I&#8217;ve been figuring out the thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; remarked Stanton with a thoughtful air,
&#8220;he wouldn&#8217;t let that land agent see him if he&#8217;d been
guilty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis reserved his opinion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting smart,&#8221; he said with a grin. &#8220;Still,
you don&#8217;t want to hustle.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hustle?&#8221; Stanton rejoined scornfully. &#8220;Jernyngham
was killed last summer and we haven&#8217;t corralled
anybody yet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; Curtis assented tranquilly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard
of the boys getting the right man nearly two years
afterward.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>PRESCOTT MAKES INQUIRIES</h3>
</div>

<p>Supper was over and Laxton, the land agent, sat
in the rotunda of the leading hotel at Navarino. It
was a handsome building, worthy of the new town
which had sprung into existence on the discovery that
a wide belt of somewhat arid country, hitherto passed
over by settlers, was capable of growing excellent wheat.
As soon as this was proved, rude shacks and mean frame
houses had been torn down, and banks, stores, and
hotels, of stone or steel and cement rose in their places.
Great irrigation ditches were dug and a period of feverish
prosperity began.
</p>
<p>Though the frost was almost arctic outside, the rotunda
was pleasantly warm and was dimmed, in spite of its
glaring lamps, with a haze of cigar smoke. In front of
the great plate-glass windows rows of men sat in tilted
chairs, their feet on a brass rail, basking in the dry heat
of the radiators. Drummers and land speculators
were busy writing and consulting maps at the tables
farther back among the ornate columns, and the place
was filled with the hum of eager voices. The town was
crowded with homestead-selectors, and many, braving
the rigors of winter, were camping on their new possessions
in frail tents and rude board shacks, ready to
begin work in the spring. Indeed, determined men
had slept in the snow on the sidewalks outside the land
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
offices to secure first attention in the morning when
cheap locations were offered for settlement.
</p>
<p>Laxton had had a tiring day, and he was leaning
back lazily in his chair, watching the crowd, when a
man entered the turnstile-door, which was fitted with
glass valves to keep out the cold. He looked about the
room as if in search of somebody; and then after speaking
to the clerk came toward the land agent. Laxton
glanced at him without much interest, having already
as much business on his hands as he could manage.
The stranger wore an old fur-coat and looked like a
rancher.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Laxton, I believe,&#8221; he said, taking the next chair.
</p>
<p>The land agent nodded and the other continued:
</p>
<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Prescott. I&#8217;ve come over from Sebastian
to have a talk with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ll have to spare you a few minutes,&#8221; said
Laxton with more resignation than curiosity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, I want to ask if you have ever seen
me before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laxton looked at him with greater interest. The
man&#8217;s brown face was eager, his eyes were keen, with a
sparkle in them that hinted at determination.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t recollect it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you be willing to swear to that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d go quite so far; I don&#8217;t see why
I should.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott took out a sheet of paper with some writing
on it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you recognize that hand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the agent decidedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bold style
that one ought to notice, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen it.&#8221;
Then he looked up sharply. &#8220;What you getting after?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain in a minute. Let me say that I&#8217;ve examined
the land sale record here, and have found a deal
registered that you were concerned in. It was made in
the name of Cyril Jernyngham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laxton started.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a lot of trouble over
this thing since I was fool enough to write to the police;
in fact, I&#8217;ve had enough of the Jernyngham case.&#8221; He
broke off for a moment as a light dawned on him and
then went on: &#8220;It&#8217;s a sure thing I haven&#8217;t met you, but,
when I think, there was a young lad something like you
among others in blanket-coats in a photograph a sergeant
brought me. Montreal snowshoe or toboggan
club, I guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how the police got it. But what did
you tell the sergeant?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Said it was no use showing me a photograph like
that, because I didn&#8217;t trade with kids.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, as I&#8217;m the man the police suspect of selling
that land of Jernyngham&#8217;s, it would be a great favor if
you&#8217;ll tell me candidly what you know about the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang up your coat,&#8221; said Laxton; &#8220;I&#8217;ll do what I can.
Anyway, you&#8217;re not the fellow I made the deal with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He drew out a cigar-case when Prescott came back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a smoke and go ahead. I&#8217;m willing to talk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, turn over the paper I gave you and look
at the signature.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyril Jernyngham!&#8221; exclaimed Laxton, astonished.
&#8220;I see your point&mdash;the hand ought to be the same as that
on the sale registration form, and I might have been expected
to recognize it, but I can&#8217;t remember all the writing
I see. However, we&#8217;ll compare it with the other signature
to-morrow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When you do so, you&#8217;ll find a difference.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Laxton. &#8220;Then whose hand is this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyril Jernyngham&#8217;s. It was written in my presence,
and what&#8217;s more important, in the presence of another
man. Now will you tell me what the fellow who made
the deal with you was like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laxton did so, and Prescott thought the description
indicated Wandle, though he was not the only man
in the neighborhood of Sebastian to whom it might
apply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you notice how he was dressed?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had on a suit of new brown clothes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott sat still, his brows knitted, his right hand
clenched. The reason why the clothes had been hidden
near his house was obvious, but there was something
else: a blurred memory that was growing into shape.
Ever since he had heard about them from Muriel, he had
been trying to think where he had seen the clothes, and
at last he seemed to hold a clue. In another few moments
it led him to the truth; everything was clear. He had
once met Wandle driving toward the settlement wearing
such a suit, and by good fortune he had shortly afterward
been overtaken by a farmer who must have seen the man.
In his excitement he struck the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I know!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;The man who forged
Jernyngham&#8217;s name hid his clothes near my house to fix
the thing on me. I owe you a good deal for your help
in a puzzling matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The agent was sympathetic, and after Prescott had
given him an outline of his connection with the case, they
sat talking over its details. Laxton had a keen intelligence
and his comments on several points were valuable.
When Prescott went to sleep it was with a weight off his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
mind; but his mood changed the next day and he traveled
back to Sebastian in a very grim humor.
</p>
<p>Open and just as he was in all his dealings, Wandle&#8217;s
treachery infuriated him. There would, he felt, have
been more extenuation for the trick had the man killed
Jernyngham, but that he should conspire to throw the
blackest suspicion on a neighbor in order to enjoy the
proceeds of a petty theft was abominable. He must be
made to suffer for it. However, Prescott did not mean
to trouble the police. He had had enough of their
cautious methods. He determined to secure a proof of
Wandle&#8217;s guilt, unassisted, without further loss of time,
and to do this he must obtain a specimen of the man&#8217;s
writing to compare with that on the land sale documents.
There was, he thought, a way of getting it.
</p>
<p>Reaching Sebastian in the evening, he was going to
the livery-stable to hire a team when he met an acquaintance
who offered to drive him home. As the man would
pass within a mile or two of Wandle&#8217;s homestead and
there was a farm in the neighborhood where he might
borrow a horse, Prescott agreed. His companion found
him preoccupied during the journey. He put him down
at a fork of the trail, and Prescott, walking on quickly
through the darkness, saw Wandle&#8217;s team standing
harnessed when he reached the house. This was a sign
that their owner had recently come home, and Prescott,
opening the door without knocking, abruptly entered the
kitchen. The lamp was lighted and Wandle, standing
near it with his fur-coat still on, looked startled. Prescott
was sensible of a burning desire to grapple with him and
extort a confession by force, but there was a risk of the
crude method defeating its object, and with strong self-denial
he determined to set to work prudently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I see you have just come in, and I&#8217;m anxious to get
home, so I won&#8217;t keep you more than a few minutes,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you come?&#8221; Wandle asked. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
hear a team.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harper drove me out. I walked up the cross trail;
but that doesn&#8217;t matter. The last time we had a talk we
fell out over the straightening up of Jernyngham&#8217;s
affairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so; you still owe me a hundred dollars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t admit it,&#8221; said Prescott, who had laid his
plans on the expectation of this claim being made.
&#8220;Anyhow, the dispute has been dragging on and it&#8217;s
time we put an end to it. It was the small items you
wanted to charge Jernyngham with that I objected to,
and I may have cut some of them down too hard. Suppose
you write me out a list.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can tell you them right away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put them down on paper; then we can figure them
out more easily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve any ink,&#8221; said Wandle. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t
you a notebook in your wallet? You used to carry one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott made a mistake in putting his hand into his
pocket, which showed that he had the book, but he remembered
that it would not suit his purpose to produce it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to make out your bill,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;That&#8217;s your business. Give me a proper list of the
disputed expenses and we&#8217;ll see what can be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was a poor diplomatist and erred in showing too
keen a desire to secure a specimen of the other&#8217;s handwriting,
which is a delicate thing to press an unskilful
forger for. Wandle was on his guard, though he carefully
hid all sign of uneasiness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll send you a list over in a day or
two; after all, if I think them over, I may be able to
knock something off one or two of the items. But now
you&#8217;re here, I want to say that you were pretty mean about
that cultivator. They&#8217;re not sold at the price you allowed
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was intended to lead Prescott away from the
main point and it succeeded, because, being at a loss for
an excuse for demanding the list immediately, he was
willing to speak of something else while he thought of one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wrong,&#8221; he said curtly. &#8220;You can get them
at any big dealer&#8217;s. I looked in at a western store where
they stock those machines, yesterday, and the fellow
gave me his schedule.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had taken off his mittens, but his hands were stiff
with cold, and when he felt in his pocket he dropped
several of the papers he brought out. The back of a
catalogue fell uppermost, and it bore the words, &#8220;Hasty&#8217;s
high-grade implements, Navarino.&#8221; Near this lay an
envelope printed with the name of a Navarino hotel.
</p>
<p>There was nothing to show that Wandle had noticed
them&mdash;he stood some distance off on the opposite side
of the table&mdash;but Prescott was too eager in gathering
them up. Opening the catalogue, he read out a description
of the cultivator and the price.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking the cash discount, it comes to a dollar less
than what I was ready to pay you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now
make out the list and we&#8217;ll try to get the thing fixed up
before I go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wandle sat down for a few moments, for he had
received a shock. His suspicions had already been
aroused, and Prescott&#8217;s motive in going to Navarino was
obvious; besides, he thought he had read Laxton&#8217;s name
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
on the envelope. He could expect no mercy&mdash;Prescott&#8217;s
face was ominously grim&mdash;and there was no doubt that,
having seen Laxton, he knew who had hidden the brown
clothes. The game was up, but, shaken by fear and rage
as he was, he rose calmly from his seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since you insist on it, I guess I&#8217;ll have to write
the thing; but I can&#8217;t leave my team standing in the frost.
Sit down and take a smoke while I put them in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott could not object to this. He lighted his pipe
when Wandle left him. He heard the door shut and
the horses being led away, for the stable stood at some
little distance from the house, and after that no further
sound reached him. Mastering his impatience, he began
to consider what he would best do when Wandle had given
him the list. He supposed he ought to hand it over to
Curtis, but he was more inclined to go back to Navarino
and compare the writing with the signature on the documents
relating to the sale. Then, having proof of the
forgery, he would communicate with the police. He
was sensible of a curious thrill at the thought that the
suspicion which had tainted him would shortly be
dispelled.
</p>
<p>After a while it occurred to him that Wandle should
have returned, but he reflected that the man might be
detained by some small task. After waiting some
minutes longer, he walked to the door, but finding that
he could not see the entrance to the stable, he stood still,
irresolute. He thought he had been firm enough, and
to betray any further eagerness would be injudicious.
The matter must be handled delicately, lest Wandle
take alarm.
</p>
<p>When he had smoked out his pipe, Prescott could no
longer restrain his impatience. He hurried toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
stable. The moonlight fell on the front of the building
and the door was open; but Prescott stopped with a start,
for all was dark inside and there was no sign of the
vehicle in which the rancher had driven home. A worse
surprise awaited him, for when he ran inside and struck
a match it was clear that Wandle and his team had
gone.
</p>
<p>Prescott dropped the match and stood still a few
moments, in savage fury. There was no doubt that he
had been cleverly tricked; Wandle, guessing his object,
had quietly driven away as soon as he had led the team
clear of the house. Moreover, Prescott had good cause
for believing that he would not come back. With an
effort, he pulled himself together. To give rein to his
anger and disappointment would serve no purpose; but
he had no horse with which to begin the pursuit. He
remembered having told Wandle so when he first entered
the house. Striking another match, he lighted a lantern
he found and eagerly looked about. A plow team occupied
two of the stalls, and though they were heavy Clydesdales
with no speed in them, they would be capable of
traveling faster than a man on foot. As he could not
find a saddle, he ran back to the house and returned with
a blanket. A bit and bridle hung on a nail, he found a
girth, but his hands were cold and he spent some time
adjusting straps and fastening on the blanket before he
led one of the horses out and mounted.
</p>
<p>The moonlight was clear enough to show him that
there were no fresh wheelmarks in the snow. Wandle
had kept to the trail, and Prescott surmised that he would
travel south toward the American boundary. Although
he feared he would lose ground steadily, he meant to
follow, since there was a chance of the fugitive&#8217;s being delayed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
by some accident, which would enable him to come
up. It was extremely cold, Prescott was not dressed for
riding, and the folded blanket made a very bad saddle.
At times pale moonlight shone down, but more often it
died away, obscured by thin cloud. The trail, however,
was plain and the big Clydesdale was covering the
ground. Prescott&#8217;s hands and feet grew numbed, and
there was a risk in this, but he trotted steadily on.
</p>
<p>After a while he heard two horsemen following him.
He did not pull up; time was precious, and if the others
wished to overtake him, he had no doubt that they could
do so. During the next few minutes it became evident
that they were gaining, and he heard a cry which he
answered without stopping. Then, as the moon came
through, another shout reached him, sharp and commanding:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, before we drop you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was not to be disregarded. Pulling up, he turned
his horse. Two mounted men rode furiously down on
him, loose snow flying about their horses, and one poised
a carbine across his saddle. Struggling to check his
horse, he swept past, shouting to his comrade:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on! It&#8217;s Prescott!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were a little distance ahead when they stopped
and trotted back, and Prescott waited until Curtis pulled
up at his side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were you going?&#8221; cried the corporal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After Wandle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I might have guessed!&#8221; said Curtis savagely, and
turned to Stanton. &#8220;This explains the thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How far is he ahead of you?&#8221; Stanton asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He got off half an hour before I did, as near as I can
guess.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>They sat silent for a moment or two, breathless and
crestfallen, their horses distressed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get into the lee of the bluff yonder; this wind&#8217;s
keen,&#8221; Curtis said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re losing time,&#8221; Prescott objected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve lost it,&#8221; Curtis told him grimly. &#8220;My mount
has been out since noon, and it&#8217;s near midnight now.
Stanton&#8217;s isn&#8217;t much fresher.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott rode with them to the bluff, where they got
down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a relief; it&#8217;s quite a while since I could
feel the bridle,&#8221; said Curtis, turning to Prescott. &#8220;How
did you scare Wandle off? Be as quick as you can!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott briefly related what led to his call at the farm
and the corporal&#8217;s face was filled with scornful anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what comes of you blamed amateurs butting
in!&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Jernyngham was bad enough, but
he can&#8217;t come near you at mussing up our plans. Guess
you don&#8217;t know that we&#8217;ve been watching Wandle for
some weeks, ready to corral him, and you start him off
like this, without warning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d reason to believe you were watching me,&#8221; Prescott
dryly rejoined.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; said Curtis, &#8220;that&#8217;s another matter. Anyhow,
I had trailed Wandle to Kelly&#8217;s place since dark,
and I&#8217;d trotted round to see if he&#8217;d got back to his
homestead when I found that he had gone. Stanton
and I were prospecting out this way when we struck your
trail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make the next farm and try to borrow horses.
Then I&#8217;ll ride to the railroad and get the wires to work.
Stanton will keep the trail by Long Lake.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll push right on by the Traverse. There&#8217;s
a ranch I should make by daylight where I might get a
mount. I&#8217;m going to see the thing through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curtis considered this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I guess you can&#8217;t do much harm,
and Wandle may not have gone by the lake after all.
You can pick up Stanton if you find out anything,
and I&#8217;ll try to join you from one of the stations along the
line.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They mounted, and on reaching the trail forks where
they must separate, Prescott turned to Curtis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you afraid of letting me out of your sight?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; Curtis answered with a smile. &#8220;You&#8217;re
not quite so important to us now; and I&#8217;m not running
much risk, anyway, considering the horse you&#8217;ve got.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>STARTLING NEWS</h3>
</div>

<p>It was noon on the day after Wandle&#8217;s flight, and
Jernyngham was sitting with his friends in a room of
the Leslie homestead when Muriel, looking out of the
window, saw Prescott&#8217;s hired man ride up at a gallop.
His haste and his anxious expression when he dismounted
alarmed her, but her companions had not noticed him,
and she waited, listening to the murmur of voices that
presently reached her from an adjoining room. They
ceased in a few minutes, she saw the man ride away as
fast as he had come, and soon afterward Leslie opened
the door. He was a talkative person and looked as if
he had something of importance to relate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Svendsen has been over to ask if I saw Prescott
when I was in at the settlement yesterday,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;When I told him that I hadn&#8217;t, he seemed mighty
disturbed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel&#8217;s heart throbbed painfully, but she waited
for one of the others to speak, and Jernyngham, laying
down his paper, glanced up sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>This was all the encouragement Leslie needed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, so far as I&#8217;ve got the hang of the thing;
I thought you&#8217;d like to know. It seems Prescott has
been away somewhere for a few days and should have
got home last night. He came in on the train in the
evening, and Harper drove him out and dropped him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
at Wandle&#8217;s trail; Prescott said he wanted to see the
man. Well, he didn&#8217;t get home, and Svendsen, who&#8217;d
been to Harper&#8217;s this morning, found Wandle gone and
three of his horses missing. Then he found out from
Watson, who stayed at the hotel last night, that Curtis
rode in on a played-out horse before it was light, and
kept the night operator busy for a while with the wires.
Seems to me the thing has a curious look.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment or two nobody spoke. Muriel felt
dismayed by the news, and she glanced at the others,
trying to read their thoughts. Colston looked troubled,
Gertrude&#8217;s face was hard and stamped with a kind of
cruel satisfaction, Jernyngham was very grim.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all you know about the matter?&#8221; Jernyngham
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; Leslie answered. &#8220;Still, Svendsen
did allow he thought he&#8217;d seen Stanton hanging about
the homestead yesterday evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Jernyngham with cold politeness.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll want the team after dinner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Seeing no excuse for remaining, the rancher went
out, and Jernyngham turned to the others. His brows
were knitted and his eyes gleamed ominously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no mystery about the matter; the man has
gone for good,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In spite of the assurances they
gave me, these fools of police have let him slip through
their fingers. That he saw Wandle before he bolted
proves collusion between them. It was a thing I half
suspected, but Curtis, of course, did not agree with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel was recovering from the shock. Though
things looked very bad, she could not believe that
Prescott had run away. He had promised to call on
Curtis and her confidence in him was unshaken.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He went away by train a day or two ago, and if
he had had anything to fear, he would have made his
escape then,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Colston cast a warning glance at her, as if
begging her to say nothing more, but Jernyngham
curtly answered her remark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man probably wanted to sell his property where
it would excite less notice than at Sebastian. Then I
suppose he found it needful to see his confederate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They could have gone off together in the first instance,&#8221;
Colston objected.
</p>
<p>Jernyngham made an impatient gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was merely suggesting an explanation; the point
is not important. The fellow has bolted; but I&#8217;ve
reason for believing he won&#8217;t get across the boundary!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off, tearing the newspaper as he opened it,
and there was an awkward silence until Mrs. Leslie
brought in dinner. Jernyngham ate very little, and after
spending a few minutes in his room, he drove off in the
sleigh. Somewhat later, Colston met Gertrude in a passage
and stopped her. He thought she looked anxious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I couldn&#8217;t calm your father, but I was
afraid that anything I might say would only make him
more excited,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;I meant to go with him,
but he wouldn&#8217;t permit it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;there was nothing that you could do;
but I&#8217;m badly disturbed.&#8221; She paused irresolutely,
and then resumed: &#8220;He has taken a magazine pistol,
though I believe it&#8217;s the first time he has carried it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colston looked grave. He determined, if possible, to
abstract the pistol and hide it on Jernyngham&#8217;s return.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry. It must be trying for you. Indeed,
I wonder anxiously where all this is leading us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The horrible mystery will be cleared up on Prescott&#8217;s
arrest,&#8221; Gertrude said in a harsh voice. &#8220;I think that
can&#8217;t be long deferred.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She left him troubled by her expression, and he and the
others spent a dreary afternoon and evening. It was late
when Jernyngham returned, looking worn but very stern.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From what I&#8217;ve learned, word has been sent to
every police trooper between here and the frontier,&#8221;
he said, and broke into a grim smile. &#8220;Prescott&#8217;s
chance of escape is a very poor one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He made a scanty meal, without seeming to notice
what he ate, and afterward sat silent. The others
seldom spoke and when a word was exchanged there
was strain in their voices. The snapping of the poplar
billets in the stove seemed to emphasize the quiet and
jarred on their nerves, while Muriel, tormented by fears
on Prescott&#8217;s account, found the suspense and constraint
almost intolerable. She was thankful when bedtime
came, though she could not sleep. Her troubled thoughts
were with her lover, and she wondered what perils he
was exposed to on the snowy wilds.
</p>
<p>As it happened, Prescott was riding steadily through
the stinging frost. He had been unable to obtain a fresh
horse, but he had borrowed a saddle, and the Clydesdale,
though far from fast, possessed good staying powers. For
all that, he had been forced to rest part of the day at an
outlying farm, and while there a man brought him word
from Stanton, whose line of travel ran roughly parallel
with his, three or four leagues to the west. The trooper&#8217;s
horse had gone badly lame, and Prescott was instructed to
push on while Stanton sought another mount.
</p>
<p>It was a very bitter night, but the young rancher was
used to cold, and, riding alone in the moonlight, he made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
the best pace he could across the white desolation.
There was no sign of life on it. Nothing moved in the
reeds beside the frozen ponds and the shadowy bluffs he
passed; no sound but the thud of heavy hoofs broke the
overwhelming silence. By and by he left the trees behind,
and pressed on into a vast glittering plain which
ran back to the horizon, unbroken by a bush, and inexpressibly
lonely.
</p>
<p>In the early morning he reached a homestead where
he rested until the afternoon. He chafed at the delay,
but as the Clydesdale was badly jaded, it could not be
avoided, and Wandle would have to stop now and then,
unless he could hire fresh horses, which might be difficult.
Starting again, he came to a small wooden settlement in
the evening and rode first to the livery-stable. The
telephone wires, which were being stretched across the
prairie, had not reached the place, and he surmised that
the police had been unable to communicate with it.
The liveryman was busy in one of the stalls, but he
came out and answered Prescott&#8217;s question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a fellow like the one you speak
of came in here about an hour ago. His team looked
pretty used up and he wanted to hire another, but
I couldn&#8217;t deal. Keep my horses hauling cordwood
through the winter, and the only team I have in the
stable is ordered by a drummer for to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you find me a mount? I&#8217;ll pay you what you
like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;When I engage to drive a
man round, I&#8217;ve got to make good. If I didn&#8217;t, it would
soon ruin my trade.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Seeing he was not to be moved, Prescott asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you strike the south trail?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go straight through the town. It forks in about three
miles, and you can take either branch. They&#8217;re both
pretty bad, but the west one&#8217;s the shorter and the worse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s between the forks?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A big patch of broken country&mdash;sandhills and
bluffs. About eight miles on, the other trail runs in
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are there any homesteads on the way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing near the trail. There&#8217;s a shack where
two fellows cutting cordwood camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott considered when he had thanked the man.
He was tired and his horse was far from fresh, but
he understood that Wandle&#8217;s team was in a worse condition.
There was a possibility of his overtaking
him, if he pushed on at once. Leaving the stable,
he meant to walk a short distance to ease his aching
limbs, but he saw a mounted man trotting up the street
and called out as he recognized Stanton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I might get news of you here,&#8221; said the
trooper, pulling up. &#8220;Have you found out anything?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott told him what he had heard, and Stanton
nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we had better get on. The horse I&#8217;ve got
is pretty fresh.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In another minute or two they had left the lights of
the settlement behind and Prescott prepared for a third
night on the trail. His eyes were heavy, long exposure to
extreme cold had had its effect on him, and the warmth
seemed to be dying out of his exhausted body. After a
while they came to a straggling clump of birches with
blurred masses of taller trees behind, where the trail
broke in two. Stanton dismounted and struck a few
matches, examining the snow carefully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to show which way Wandle&#8217;s gone,&#8221; he
reported. &#8220;Somebody&#8217;s been along with a bob-sled not
long ago and rubbed out his tracks. Anyhow, I&#8217;ll
take the shorter fork.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They separated; the trooper riding on in the moonlight
and Prescott entering the gloom of the trees. He
soon found the trial remarkably uneven. So far as he
could make out, it skirted a number of low, thickly
timbered ridges, swinging sharply up and down. In
places it slanted awkwardly toward one edge; in others it
was covered with stiff, dwarf scrub. One or two of the
descents to frozen creeks were alarmingly steep and the
Clydesdale stumbled now and then, but it kept its feet and
Prescott felt that, everything considered, he was making
a satisfactory pace. Stanton, he supposed, was two or
three miles to the west of him, following the opposite
edge of the high ground, but there was nothing to indicate
which of them was the nearer to Wandle.
</p>
<p>He rode on, wishing the light were better, for the faint
gleam of the moon among the trees confused his sight and
made it difficult to distinguish the trail, while to leave it
might lead to his plunging down some precipitous gully.
At length he saw a yellow glow ahead, and soon afterward
came upon a shack in an opening. Small logs were
strewn about it and among them stood tall piles of cordwood.
The door opened as he rode up and a man&#8217;s dark
figure appeared in the entrance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen a rig going south?&#8221; Prescott asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard one, about seven or eight minutes ago.
The fellow didn&#8217;t seem to be driving quick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; responded Prescott, and rode off with a
feeling of satisfaction.
</p>
<p>He had gained on Wandle, who had probably been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
delayed by some mischance on the trail. If the Clydesdale
could be urged to a faster pace, he might overtake
him, but this must be done before the fugitive could hire
a fresh team. Next, he began to wonder what progress
Stanton had made, for the relative positions of Wandle
and the constable were now important. If Stanton were
far enough ahead, he would reach the spot where the trails
united before the absconder, in which case they would
have him between them and it would be better for Prescott
to save his horse&#8217;s strength, because speed might be
required. On the contrary, if Stanton were not yet
abreast of him, he ought to push on as fast as possible.
Wandle, he was glad to remember, could not know how
closely he was being followed.
</p>
<p>Turning the matter over in his mind, he rode at a
moderate pace while the rough track wound deeper into
the bluff. The partial obscurity was now extremely
puzzling. Here and there a slender trunk glimmered in
the faint moonlight that streamed down between the
branches, and patches of brightness lay across the path,
but this intensified the darkness of the background. It
was hard to tell which of the dim avenues that kept opening
up was the trail; the state of the short scrub could no
longer be used as a guide, for the cordwood cutters had not
penetrated so far with their sled.
</p>
<p>Prescott knew that he must go forward, however; and
he was gazing anxiously ahead with eyes that ached from
long exposure to the reflection from the snow when the
Clydesdale stumbled violently. He had scarcely time to
clear his feet of the stirrups before the beast went down
and he was flung into a clump of brush with a force that
nearly drove the breath out of him. For a few moments
he lay still, dimly conscious that the horse was struggling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
in the snow; and then, rousing himself with an effort,
he got up unsteadily. He felt badly shaken, but he saw
the horse scramble to its feet without assistance and stand
trembling, looking about for him.
</p>
<p>Neither he nor the animal seemed to be seriously
injured, but he felt incapable of mounting and waited
a while, wondering what he should do. He was tired out
and was sensible of a depressing lassitude, the result of
nervous strain. Then, as the bitter cold nipped him, a
reaction set in. Wandle, he remembered, had with
detestable cunning plotted to ruin him; it might be difficult
to clear himself unless the man were arrested. For
the sake of the girl who had maintained his innocence
with steadfast faith, the suspicion under which he labored
must be dispelled. Prescott was seized by a fit of fury
against his betrayer. Nerved by it, he got into the saddle
and rode on, urging the Clydesdale savagely through the
wood.
</p>
<p>Half an hour later he heard a measured drumming
sound and Stanton&#8217;s voice answered his hail. Then a
horseman rode out of a gap in the trees and pulled up
near him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you have seen nothing of Wandle?&#8221; Prescott
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a sign,&#8221; said Stanton shortly. &#8220;Have you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott raised his hand and sat listening while he
struggled with his rage and disappointment. The night
was still; he thought he would hear any sound there might
be a long distance off, but nothing broke the silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I learned from a chopper that I wasn&#8217;t far behind
him, and I half expected you would have headed him off.
I can&#8217;t think he has passed this spot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try to fix that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>Stanton dismounted and struck several matches. The
flame burned steadily, but it showed none of the marks
for which he searched the beaten snow with practised
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;d stake a month&#8217;s pay that the
fellow&#8217;s not ahead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They looked at each other, frankly puzzled; and then
Prescott broke out angrily:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where can the blasted rustler be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t have left the bluffs on my side without my
seeing him, and if he&#8217;d doubled back on his tracks,
you&#8217;d have met him,&#8221; Curtis remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not likely to be hiding in the woods. He&#8217;d
freeze without a proper outfit, which he can&#8217;t have got.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They grappled with the problem in silence for a minute
or two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take the back trail,&#8221; Stanton decided. &#8220;The
fellow must have broken out for open country on your
side. I guess he knows where there&#8217;s a homestead
where he might find a team.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott agreed, and they rode off wearily the way he
had come, shivering with the cold that had seized them
while they waited. The expectant excitement which had
animated them for the past hour had gone and was
followed by a reaction. Their bodies were half frozen,
their minds worked heavily, but both were conscious of a
grim resolve. It was the trooper&#8217;s duty to bear crushing
fatigue and stinging frost, one that was sternly demanded
of him; and the rancher had a stronger motive. He
must clear himself for Muriel&#8217;s sake, and he was filled
with rage against the man who had tried to betray him.
He would go on, if necessary, until his hands and feet
froze or the big Clydesdale fell.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE END OF THE PURSUIT</h3>
</div>

<p>When they had ridden some distance through the
wood, Stanton checked his horse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a bit of an opening
in the brush!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He moved away a few yards, and then called out:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks mighty like a trail. I guess you didn&#8217;t notice
it when you came along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott admitted that he had not done so, which was
not surprising. There was little to distinguish the gap
between the nut bushes from others that opened up all
round; but Stanton seemed satisfied that he was right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody has driven out this way not long ago,&#8221;
he explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t follow that the man was Wandle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no. Still, I guess it&#8217;s likely; and if there&#8217;s a
trail, it leads to a homestead. Anyway, we&#8217;ll track it
up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When they reached the open prairie, the moonlight
showed faint wheelmarks running on before them to
the east. The country was open and empty; a wide
plain, with one slight rise some miles away that cut with
a white gleam against the deep blue of the sky. They
headed toward it wearily, following the track, and drew
bridle when they gained the summit. A half-moon
floated rather low in the western sky, glittering keen
with frost, and they could see that the prairie ahead of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
them was more rolling and broken. Dusky smears of
bluffs checkered its white surface here and there, and a
low irregular dark line ran across it. Prescott supposed
this to be a small timber growing along the edge of a
ravine. Beyond it, in the distance, a faint glimmer of
yellow light caught and held his eye. It was the one
touch of warm color in the chill and lifeless waste of
white and blue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A homestead,&#8221; said Stanton. &#8220;We&#8217;ll ride as far as
the ravine together; and then I guess I&#8217;ll make for the
farm alone. If Wandle&#8217;s been there looking for horses,
he&#8217;ll strike south and take the trail we left, farther on.
You&#8217;ll head down that way and watch out to cut him off
if he lights out before I come up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott understood the maneuver. By driving east
the fugitive had lost ground, and if he could push on fast
enough, Prescott might reach a position from which he
could either run him down or turn him back into the hands
of the trooper.
</p>
<p>When they came to the ravine and descended the deep
shadowy hollow, they parted company, Prescott following
the opposite brink, because Wandle would have to cross
it lower down to regain the south trail. Once or twice
he left it for a while when the gorge twisted in a big loop
away from him, but he could see nothing of his companion.
They had commanded a wide sweep of plain when
they crossed the rise, but now that he was on low ground,
the scattered bluffs obstructed his view. Indeed, he
fancied from their position that they would prevent
Stanton&#8217;s seeing the farm. Once he stopped and listened
with strained attention, but he could hear only the faint
sighing of a light wind among the trees he skirted and the
snapping of a twig, made by what means he could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
tell, for there was no sign of life in all the frozen wilds.
It was very dreary, and Prescott had little expectation of
overtaking Wandle after the time they had lost, but he
doggedly rode on.
</p>
<p>At length an indistinct sound, too regular for the wind
to account for, reached him, and grew louder when he
pulled up his horse. It was a dull, measured throbbing,
and he knew it to be the beat of hoofs. It was drawing
nearer, but it might be made by Stanton riding to join
him, and he headed so as to clear one of the bluffs which
prevented his seeing far across the plain. On passing
the end of the timber he saw another taller patch half a
mile off, which hid most of the prairie between him and
the farm, and knowing that time might be valuable he
clung to the ravine, urging the jaded Clydesdale to its
fastest pace, which was very moderate. He had gone
about a mile, opening up the flat waste beyond the second
bluff, when the black shape of a team and rig appeared
on it. The team was being driven furiously, and in
another few moments Prescott was not surprised to see
a horseman sweep out from the gloom of the trees behind
them. It was, however, soon obvious that the trooper
was not gaining ground; Wandle had got fresh horses,
his rig was light, while Stanton&#8217;s mount had already
carried him a long way. Prescott&#8217;s Clydesdale had been
harder taxed, but he knew he could not spare the beast.
Wandle must have seen him, but he was holding straight
on, and this could only be because he was following a
trail which led to the easiest crossing of the ravine. The
man would shrink from the risk of getting entangled
among thick timber with his team.
</p>
<p>Prescott would have found speed difficult, even had he
been mounted on a fresh horse. The snow was thin, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
it was loose and dusty beneath the crust, through which
the hoofs broke, while Wandle was making excellent
progress along a beaten trail. Still, Prescott was nearer
to the point the man was making for, and if he could reach
it first, Wandle could not escape. Riding with savage
determination, he sped on, the snow flying up behind
him, the thrill of the pursuit firing his blood and
filling him with fierce excitement. Wandle&#8217;s fresh
team was going at a gallop, the hoofs beating out a sharp
drumming that mingled with the furious rattle of wheels,
and through these sounds broke a rapid, pounding thud
which told that Stanton was following hard behind.
The trooper was, however, less close than he had been;
too far, Prescott thought, to use his carbine; and as he
mercilessly drove his beast he feared that he could
scarcely reach the trail in time. He was closing with the
rig and could see Wandle savagely lash his team; the
trouble was that instead of riding to cut off the fugitive,
in another few minutes he would be behind him, which
was a very different thing.
</p>
<p>While he plied the quirt he saw the rig vanish among
the trees close ahead. They stretched out some distance
into the prairie, and he might not be too late yet, if he
were willing to take a serious risk. He did not think
the trail ran straight down into the ravine&mdash;the hollow
was too deep for that&mdash;it would descend the slope obliquely
and might trend toward him. If so, he should
still be able to intercept the rig by cutting off the corner
and riding straight down the steep bank through the
timber. The odds were in favor of his killing the horse
and breaking his own neck, but this did not count,
and the next moment there was a crash as the
Clydesdale rushed through a brake. A branch struck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
Prescott&#8217;s leg a heavy blow, but he was too numbed to
feel much pain, and as he swung round a bush that threatened
to tear him from the saddle he could look down
between the trees. Then he was filled with exultation,
for the trail had turned his way. Below him, but farther
from the bottom of the dipping track than he was,
Wandle&#8217;s horses were plunging downhill at a furious
gallop, the rig jolting behind them, the driver leaning
forward and using the whip. There was no sign of Stanton
except the pounding of hoofs that rose among the
trees.
</p>
<p>Then the slope grew dangerously sharp and Prescott
set his teeth. The Clydesdale flinched from the descent,
but it was too jaded to struggle hard, and the next
moment it stumbled and slid over the edge. They went
down, slipping over ground as hard as granite under its
thin coat of snow, smashing through nut bushes, tearing
off low branches. Prescott saw Wandle turn his head
and look up at him. Then the fugitive sent up a hoarse
cry of rage and warning, too late. If he could stop his
team, which was very doubtful, he might escape the
threatened collision; but this would involve his capture
by Stanton, and he lashed his horses and went on, while
Prescott and the great plow horse came madly rushing
down at him. He looked at them again, with a breathless
yell; then he let the reins fall and seized a seat rail.
</p>
<p>The Clydesdale struck the light off-side horse, hurling
it upon its fellow, breaking the pole. Both lost their
footing and were driven round. Prescott, flung upon the
backs of the horses, grasped the front of the rig, which
ran on a yard or two and overturned with a crash. The
Clydesdale went down among the wreckage, another
horse was on its side, kicking savagely; and Stanton,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
hurrying up, saw Prescott crawl slowly clear of it. Seizing
him, he lifted him to his feet, and to his great surprise
the man leaned against a tree with a half-dazed
laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he gasped, &#8220;I&#8217;m not in pieces, anyway!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you ought to be!&#8221; said Stanton, too startled to
congratulate him on his escape. &#8220;But where&#8217;s Wandle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott seemed unable to answer and the trooper,
looking round, saw Wandle lying in the snow; but
before he could reach him the man began to raise himself
on his elbow. This was disconcerting, for Stanton had
thought him dead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the trooper said stupidly, &#8220;what&#8217;s the matter
with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Wandle replied weakly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
feel like talking; let me alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stanton had no fear of his escaping, so he went back
to the horses. One of them stood trembling, attached
to the rig by the deranged harness; the other still lay
kicking, while the big Clydesdale rolled to and fro, with
its leg through a wrenched-off wheel. It was astonishing
that none of them was killed. Prescott apparently needed
no assistance, and Stanton felt that he required some
occupation to calm himself. Accordingly, he freed the
Clydesdale of the broken wheel, narrowly escaping a
kick which would have broken his ribs. The horse was
a valuable one and must not be left in danger, and after a
few minutes of severe exertion Stanton got it on its feet.
Then he turned to the fallen driving horse and began, at
some risk, to cut away its harness. Prescott came to
help him, and together they raised the beast. Then
Stanton sat down heavily on the wreckage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;that was the blamedest fool
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
trick, your riding down the grade; they wouldn&#8217;t expect
that kind of work from us in the service! What I can&#8217;t
account for is that you look none the worse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott, standing shakily in the moonlight, smiled.
&#8220;It is surprising; but hadn&#8217;t you better look after Wandle?
He seems to be getting up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wandle was cautiously getting on his feet, and the
trooper watched him until he moved a pace or two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look very broke up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do you
feel as if you could walk?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I could ride,&#8221; Wandle answered sullenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess you won&#8217;t. You have given us trouble
enough already, and you&#8217;ll be warmer on your feet.&#8221;
Then he drew out a paper. &#8220;This is my warrant. It&#8217;s
my duty to arrest you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wandle listened coolly to the formula, in which
he was charged with fraudulently selling Jernyngham&#8217;s
land and forging his name. Indeed, Prescott fancied
that he was relieved to find that nothing more serious
had been brought against him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll hear my defense when it&#8217;s
ready. What&#8217;s to be done now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Head back to the homestead where you got the team.
Think you can lead one of them? It&#8217;s either that or I&#8217;ll
put the handcuffs on you&mdash;make your choice.&#8221; Stanton
turned to Prescott. &#8220;It will be warmer walking, and
I&#8217;ve ridden about enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The suggestion was agreed to, and after looping up the
cut harness awkwardly with numbed fingers, they set
off; Wandle going first, holding one horse&#8217;s head, Prescott
following with two, and the trooper bringing up the rear.
When they reached the farm, to the astonishment of its
occupants, they were given quarters in the kitchen, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
a big stove was burning. Soon afterward, Prescott and
Wandle lay down on the wooden floor, wrapped in
blankets supplied them by the farmer, and Prescott sank
into heavy sleep. Stanton, sitting upright in an uncomfortable
chair, kept watch with his carbine laid handy on
the table. He spent the night in a tense struggle to keep
awake, and when Prescott got up at dawn the trooper&#8217;s
face was haggard and his eyes half closed, but he was still
on guard.
</p>
<p>After breakfast, they borrowed a saddle for Wandle
and set out on the return journey, meeting Curtis, who
had ridden from the railroad, at the first settlement they
reached. Prescott left the others there, and rode toward
the station the corporal had just left, taking some telegrams
Curtis asked him to despatch. He spent an
afternoon and a night in the little wooden town, and
went on again the next day by a local train.
</p>
<p>While Prescott was on the way, Jernyngham drove
to Sebastian with Gertrude. The girl had insisted on
accompanying him. Soon after they left the homestead
Colston, who was trying to read a paper from which
his interest wandered, looked up at his wife.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine weather and not quite so cold,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Suppose we go to the settlement and get supper there?
I&#8217;ve no doubt there&#8217;s something you or Muriel would
like to buy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As it happens, there is,&#8221; Mrs. Colston replied.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s all you have in your mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is, I&#8217;m disturbed about Jernyngham,&#8221; Colston
admitted. &#8220;He has been in an extremely restless
mood since Prescott disappeared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have noticed that. But do you know why he has
gone to Sebastian to-day?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He told me. One of the police authorities, whom
he has seen already, is staying at the hotel to-night.
Jernyngham means to get hold of him and insist upon
an explanation of what they are doing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel leaned forward in her chair. She looked
anxious, for no news of anything that had happened
since Wandle&#8217;s flight had reached the neighborhood.
It was only known that the police were in pursuit of
him; and local opinion was divided as to whether Prescott
was also a fugitive or, knowing more about the matter
than anybody else, had offered Curtis his assistance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you ought to go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And you may
hear something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Colston replied, &#8220;I&#8217;ll confess that I&#8217;m curious,
though I&#8217;m going mainly on Jernyngham&#8217;s account.&#8221;
He turned to his wife. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s advisable?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, and it would be better if we all went. Then
you will have an excuse for following Jernyngham and
can watch him without making the thing too marked.
It&#8217;s a pity you didn&#8217;t succeed in getting the pistol away
from him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done what I could. I had another try this
morning, but he caught me looking for it and I believe
he guessed what I was after, because he was unusually
short with me. It&#8217;s my opinion that he has taken to
wearing the thing; so far as I can discover, it&#8217;s nowhere
in the house. One hesitates about ransacking his room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not in the house, and he is not to be trusted
with it,&#8221; Muriel said quietly.
</p>
<p>Colston cast a surprised glance at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! You seem to know. I&#8217;ve no doubt you are
cleverer with your fingers than I am and wouldn&#8217;t be
so afraid of leaving your tracks.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gertrude knows where the pistol is and she thought
it necessary to go with her father,&#8221; Mrs. Colston said
significantly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get off as soon as you have asked
Leslie for the buggy; I wish it had been the sleigh.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They drove away in half an hour; but Jernyngham
reached the settlement some time before they did.
Leaving Gertrude at a drygoods store, he went to the
hotel, where the commissioned officer of police had a
room. The officer was acquainted with all that Prescott
had told Curtis about his absence in search of the missing
man, and had been advised by telegraph of the assistance
he had rendered in Wandle&#8217;s arrest. This was, however,
a matter that must stand in abeyance until he saw
Curtis, for he had come down to investigate some complaints
about the reservation Indians, who were in a
restless, discontented state, and the business demanded
careful thought and handling. He was studying the
report of a local constable when there was a knock at
the door, and he looked up with annoyance as Jernyngham
came in. The man had his sympathy, but he was
troublesome.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t spare you more than a minute or
two,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m expecting a constable I&#8217;ve sent for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One would have imagined that my business was
of the first importance,&#8221; Jernyngham rejoined. &#8220;Have
you any news of the fugitives?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wandle has been arrested.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! That&#8217;s satisfactory, though I don&#8217;t think it will
carry us very far. His attempt to escape with Prescott,
however, makes it obvious that they were confederates.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The officer let this remark pass, for he was anxious
to get rid of his visitor. Jernyngham was piqued by his
silence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you have not apprehended Prescott yet?&#8221;
he resumed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered the other shortly. &#8220;He will remain
at liberty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door and a trooper looked
in and withdrew.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Jernyngham,&#8221; said the officer, &#8220;if you will
make an appointment to meet me on my return from
the reservation, I will be at your service, but you must
excuse me now. I have some instructions to give the
constable, who has a long ride before him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A minute, please; I&#8217;ll be brief. Am I to understand
that you have no intention of seizing Prescott?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I meant. So far as I can determine at
present, we shall not interfere with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham&#8217;s haggard face grew red with anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are your grounds for this extraordinary decision?&#8221;
he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A strong presumption of his innocence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Preposterous!&#8221; Jernyngham broke out. &#8220;The scoundrel
killed my son, and you refuse to move any further
against him! I must carry the matter to Ottawa; you
leave me no recourse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The officer rapped on the table and the trooper entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and see me when I get back, Mr. Jernyngham,
and we&#8217;ll talk over the thing again. I have other business
which demands urgent attention now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham&#8217;s face was deeply colored and the swollen
veins showed on his forehead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Understand that I insist on Prescott&#8217;s arrest! I will,
spare no effort to secure it through your superiors!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Seeing that he was in no mood to listen to reason, the
officer let him go, and Jernyngham walked slowly to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
the lobby downstairs. There were a number of men in
it, but two or three strolled into the bar and the others
drew away from him when he sat down. They were not
without compassion, but they shrank from the grim look
in the man&#8217;s worn face. For a while he sat still, resting
one elbow on a table, and trying to arrange his confused
thoughts. He knew nothing of Prescott&#8217;s interview with
Curtis or the reason for his visit to Wandle on the night
of the latter&#8217;s flight; the discovery of the brown clothes
occupied the most prominent place in his mind, and
convinced him of Prescott&#8217;s guilt.
</p>
<p>Then he began to consider how he could best bring
pressure to bear on the administration in Ottawa. From
inquiries he had made, it appeared less easy than he had
supposed. It was, he had been told, unusual for anybody
to interfere with the Northwest Police, who had been
entrusted with extensive powers; and there was a strong
probability of his failing to obtain satisfaction. It was,
however, unthinkable that Prescott should escape.
Jernyngham&#8217;s poignant sense of loss and regret for past
harshness to his son had merged into an overwhelming
desire for vengeance on the man whom he regarded as
Cyril&#8217;s murderer. He was left without an ally; the organized
means of justice had signally broken down;
but the man should not go unpunished.
</p>
<p>Tormented by his thoughts, he went out in search of
Gertrude.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>JERNYNGHAM BREAKS DOWN</h3>
</div>

<p>Colston and his party were leaving the hotel, with
Jernyngham and Gertrude a few paces in front of
them. A big lamp hung beneath the veranda, and the
light from the windows streamed out on the snow.
While Colston held the door open for his wife and Muriel
to pass through a man came hurriedly along the sidewalk
and Colston started.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quick!&#8221; he cried to Muriel. &#8220;It&#8217;s Prescott!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Letting the door swing to, he moved hastily forward,
and then stopped, seeing that he was too late to prevent
the meeting. Jernyngham had recognized the newcomer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Prescott,&#8221; the old man cried, &#8220;a word with you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott stopped with a troubled face a few yards
away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you insist, I&#8217;m at your service.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colston drew nearer. Jernyngham&#8217;s tone had alarmed
him, and it&#8217;s ominous harshness was more marked when
he resumed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last time, I ask you, where is my son?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I knew,&#8221; said Prescott quietly. &#8220;I believe
he&#8217;s in British Columbia, but it&#8217;s a big province and I
lost trace of him there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie!&#8221; Jernyngham cried, hoarse with fury.
&#8220;Your tricks won&#8217;t serve you; I&#8217;ll have the truth!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be calm, Mr. Jernyngham,&#8221; Colston begged, touching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
his arm. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have a crowd here in a few moments.
Come back into the hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was violently pushed away. Jernyngham&#8217;s eyes
glittered, his face was grimly set; it was obvious that his
self-control had deserted him. Seeing that he could
not be reasoned with, Colston left him alone and waited,
ready to interfere if necessary. The man, he thought,
was in a dangerous mood; the situation was liable to
have alarming developments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you speak?&#8221; Jernyngham stormed at
Prescott. &#8220;You shall not leave the spot until we hear
your confession!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott stood still, looking at him steadily, with pity
in his face. He made a striking figure in the glare of
light, finely posed, with no sign of shrinking. The others
had fixed their eyes on him, and did not notice Muriel
move quietly through the shadow of the wooden pillars.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have nothing to confess,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Jernyngham&#8217;s fur coat was open and his hand dropped
quickly to a pocket. As he brought it out Colston sprang
forward, a moment too late; but Muriel was before him,
her hand on the man&#8217;s arm. There was a flash, a sharp
report, and blue smoke curled up toward the veranda,
but Prescott stood still, untouched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quick!&#8221; screamed Muriel. &#8220;He&#8217;s trying to fire
again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no time to be particular. Colston seized
the elder man, dragging him backward several paces
before he wrenched the pistol from him. Then he
paused, breathless, looking about in a half-dazed fashion.
Everything had happened with startling suddenness, and
the scene under the veranda was an impressive one.
His wife clutched one of the pillars as if unnerved.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
Gertrude leaned against the sidewalk rail, her face tense
with horror, and Jernyngham stood with a slackness of
carriage which suggested that power of thought and
physical force had suddenly left him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, are you hurt?&#8221; cried Muriel clinging to
Prescott.
</p>
<p>The tension was relieved by the appearance of the
commissioned officer, who sprang out of the hotel with
the constable close behind him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut the door and keep them in!&#8221; he ordered.
</p>
<p>The constable obeyed, but his efforts were wasted,
for men were already hurrying out through the separate
entrance to the bar and from an adjoining store. Others
ran out from the houses, and the street was rapidly filling
with an eager crowd.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand back there!&#8221; called the officer sharply. Then
he turned to the group under the veranda. &#8220;Now what&#8217;s
this? I heard a shot!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Colston, pulling himself together, though
his manner was confused; &#8220;there was one. I don&#8217;t
know how it happened&mdash;it was a surprise to us all. I
don&#8217;t think the pistol&#8217;s safe; it goes off too easily. However,
the most important thing is that nobody is hurt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fortunate. I&#8217;ll take the weapon from you,&#8221;
replied the officer dryly.
</p>
<p>When Colston had given it to him, as if glad to be rid
of it, the officer noted the positions and attitudes of the
others before he turned to Prescott.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me anything?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; Prescott answered. &#8220;Of course,
I saw the flash, but the bullet didn&#8217;t come anywhere near
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Gertrude&#8217;s nerve gave way. All that had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
happened was her work; she had, when her father was
wavering and questioning the justice of his suspicions,
driven them back more firmly into his mind, and as a
result of this he had come near to killing an innocent
man. Overwhelmed by the thought, she swayed unsteadily
and fell back against the rails.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Jernyngham is fainting!&#8221; Mrs. Colston cried,
hurrying toward her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring her in!&#8221; said the officer; and when this was
done, with Colston&#8217;s assistance, he called to the constable:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand at the door; keep everybody out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The big lobby was cleared, and the officer gravely
watched the way the actors of the scene arranged
themselves. Prescott stood well apart from the others
with Muriel at his side. She was flushed and overstrung,
but her pose and expression suggested that she
was defying the rest, and she cast a hard, unsympathetic
glance at Gertrude, who sat limply, with clenched
hands. Colston, looking embarrassed and unhappy,
sat near his wife, who had preserved some composure.
Jernyngham leaned against the counter, dejected and
apparently half dazed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you go any farther, I&#8217;d better tell you that I
fired the shot,&#8221; he said brokenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I came out, the pistol was in Mr. Colston&#8217;s
hand,&#8221; the officer pointed out in a meaning tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; Colston broke in. &#8220;I took it from him,
for fear of an accident. Mr. Jernyngham was in a very
nervous and excited state. He has, of course, been
bearing a heavy strain, and I imagine you must have
said something that rather upset his balance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was perfectly sensible!&#8221; Jernyngham harshly interrupted
him. &#8220;I found I could get no assistance from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
the police; it looked as if my son&#8217;s death must go
unavenged!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colston raised his hand to check him. Jernyngham
could not be allowed to explain his action, as he seemed
bent on doing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No! no!&#8221; he said soothingly, &#8220;you mustn&#8217;t think of it!
Please let me speak.&#8221; He addressed the officer. &#8220;You
can see the nervous state Mr. Jernyngham is in&mdash;very
natural, of course, but I think it should appeal to your
consideration.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The officer reflected. He had been brought up in the
old country, and could sympathize with the people before
him; they deserved pity, and he had no wish to humiliate
them. Moreover, Miss Hurst, whom he admired, seemed
to be involved. These reasons could not be allowed to
carry much weight, but there were others. It was obvious
that Jernyngham was hardly responsible for his actions;
the man&#8217;s worn and haggard face showed that he had
been severely tried. Justice would not be served by probing
the matter too deeply, and Colston&#8217;s attitude indicated
that this would be difficult.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you seem to be the one who had the narrowest
escape, Mr. Prescott, have you any complaint to make?&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;None whatever. I&#8217;m sorry the thing has made so
much stir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was my duty to investigate it. But I think that a
charge of unlawfully carrying dangerous weapons, which
is punishable by a fine, will meet the case.&#8221; He turned
to the trooper. &#8220;You will attend to the matter in due
course, Constable Slade.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he bowed to the company and went out, leaving
Colston to deal with the situation with the assistance of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
his wife, who thought it desirable to break up the party
as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The teams must be ready, and it&#8217;s too cold to keep
them standing,&#8221; she remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re outside,&#8221; said Colston. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be mobbed
by an inquisitive crowd, if we don&#8217;t get off at once. Gertrude,
bring your father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude led Jernyngham to the door, and Colston
turned back to Prescott.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very regretable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are grateful
for your forbearance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then his wife joined him, calling to Muriel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quick! The people haven&#8217;t gone away; the
street&#8217;s full!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel, disregarding her, looked at Prescott, who had
spoken to nobody except the officer. His face was troubled,
but he made no attempt to detain her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you saved my life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
thank you now. May I call to-morrow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We should be glad to see you,&#8221; Mrs. Colston broke
in hurriedly; &#8220;but, with Mr. Jernyngham at the homestead,
wouldn&#8217;t it be embarrassing? Muriel, we really
can&#8217;t wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl smiled at Prescott.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said quietly, &#8220;come when you wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then her sister, knowing that she was beaten, drew
her firmly away.
</p>
<p>They went out and Prescott sat down, feeling that he
had done right and yet half ashamed of his reserve, for he
had seen that Muriel had expected him to claim her and
was ready to acknowledge him before her friends. This,
however, was when she was overstrung and under the
influence of strong excitement; the sacrifice she did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
shrink from making was a heavy one, and she must
have an opportunity for considering it calmly. He was
not long left undisturbed, for men flocked in, anxious for
an account of the affair, but he put them off with evasive
answers and, making his escape, hurried to the livery-stable
where he hired a team.
</p>
<p>The next afternoon he drove to Leslie&#8217;s in a quietly
exultant mood. His long fight was over; nature had
beaten him, and he was glad to yield, though he had
not done so under sudden stress of passion. During
his search for Jernyngham and afterward sitting by
his stove on bitter nights, he had come to see that if
the girl he desired loved him, no merely prudential
reasons ought to separate them. He had feared to
drag her down, to rob her of things she valued, but
he now saw that she might, after all, hold them of
little account. He was, for his station, a prosperous
man; his wife need suffer no real deprivation; he had
a firm belief in the future of his adopted country, and
knew that in a little while all the amenities of civilized
life could be enjoyed in it. Wandle&#8217;s trial would free
him of suspicion; when he had stood facing Jernyngham,
Muriel had revealed her love for him, and since it
could not be doubted, he need not hesitate. It was
her right to choose whether she would marry him.
Only she must clearly realize all that this would imply.
</p>
<p>He had expected some opposition from Mrs. Colston,
but, when it was inevitable, she could gracefully bear defeat.
Moreover, she had never agreed with Jernyngham&#8217;s
suspicions of Prescott, and in some respects he impressed
her favorably. There was no reserve in her greeting when
he reached the homestead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The less that is said about last night, the better,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
but I can&#8217;t pass over it without expressing our gratitude
for the position you took,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Harry has driven
Jernyngham out in the sleigh&mdash;he has been in a curious
limp state all morning&mdash;and Gertrude has not yet got
over the shock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been very trying for Miss Jernyngham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt.&#8221; There was not much pity in Mrs.
Colston&#8217;s voice, for she could guess how matters stood.
&#8220;However, I am disengaged and I believe Muriel will
be here directly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott followed her into a room and made an effort
to talk to her until she rose and went out as Muriel
entered. The girl, to his surprise, was dressed in furs,
and he felt his heart beat when she looked at him with a
shy smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been expecting you,&#8221; she said, giving him her
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he asked gravely, &#8220;whether you can guess
why I have come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered in a steady voice; &#8220;I think I can.
But we&#8217;ll go out, Jack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He followed her, puzzled, but not questioning her wish,
and they walked silently down the beaten trail that
stretched away, a streak of grayish blue, across the
glittering snow. Brilliant sunshine streamed down on
them and the nipping air was wonderfully clear. When
they passed a birch bluff that hid them from the house;
Prescott stopped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Muriel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I think you know that I love
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a warm color in her face, but for a moment
she met his eyes squarely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I knew it some time ago, though perhaps I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
should have shrunk from confessing that so frankly, if
it hadn&#8217;t been for last night. But why were you afraid of
telling me, Jack?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He read surrender in her face and yielding pose, and
with a strange humility that tempered the wild thrill of
delight he placed his arm about her. Then, as she crept
closer to him, resting her head on his shoulder, every
feeling was lost in a delirious sense of triumph. It was
brief, for he remembered how he was handicapped, and
he held her from him, looking gravely down at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear, there is something to be said.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she rejoined with tender mockery; &#8220;you
either took a great deal for granted or there was one
important thing you were willing to leave in doubt.
Now take my hands and hold them fast. You know
I have suffered something&mdash;fears and anxieties because of
you&mdash;I want to feel safe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did as she bade him and she looked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now listen, Jack dear. All that I have to give, my
love, my closest trust, is yours, and because you said I
saved your life, that belongs to me. I think it&#8217;s all that
matters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was silent for a few moments, overwhelmed by
a sense of his responsibility.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; he urged, &#8220;you must understand what you are
risking. I should have told you first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel released her hands, and her glance was grave.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; you had better continue, Jack. I suppose we
must speak of these things now, and then forget them
forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what Jernyngham believed of me. I
could not marry you with such a stain on my name;
but it will be wiped off in a few more days, and this I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
owe to you. It was you who insisted that I should clear
myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She started.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember that I know nothing, except that you went
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott told her briefly what he had learned at Navarino
and of Wandle&#8217;s capture; and her deep satisfaction
was obvious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;This will make it
easier for the others, though it doesn&#8217;t affect me. If I
had had any doubts, I couldn&#8217;t have loved you. But
I&#8217;m pleased you told me before you were really cleared.
To have waited until everybody knew you were innocent
would have looked as if you were afraid to test my faith in
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said; &#8220;that couldn&#8217;t be. I was afraid of
your having to make too heavy a sacrifice; and, unfortunately,
there&#8217;s some risk of that still.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, Jack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m far from a rich man, though I never regretted
it much until of late. You know how we live here;
I can guess what you have enjoyed at home. Life&#8217;s
strenuous on the prairie, and though I think it&#8217;s good,
it makes demands on one you can&#8217;t have felt in England.
There&#8217;s so much that you must give up, many things
that you will miss. I am anxious when I think of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel looked far across the plain which ran back;
glistening in the sunlight, until it faded into cold blues
and purples toward the skyline. The gray bluffs,
standing one behind the other, and the long straggling
line of timber by a ravine marked its vast extent. It
filled the girl with a sense of freedom; its wideness
uplifted her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I wonder whether you can understand
why I made you take me out? The prairie has
drawn me from the beginning, and I felt it would be
easier to make a great change in this wonderful open
space; I wanted to adopt the country, to feel it belonged
to me. Now that I&#8217;ve made my choice, my home is
where you are; I want nothing but to be loved and cared
for, as you must care for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott drew her toward him, but there was more
of respect than passion in his caress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he said gravely, &#8220;I feel very humble as
well as thankful. It&#8217;s a great thing I&#8217;ve undertaken,
to make you happy; and I think you&#8217;ll try to forgive me
if I sometimes fail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel laughed and shook herself free.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not really hard to please, and even if you make
mistakes now and then, good intentions count for a
good deal. But you are dreadfully solemn, and there&#8217;s
so much that is pleasant to talk about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They walked on briskly, for it had been possible to
stand still only in the shelter of the bluff with bright
sunshine streaming down on them; the cold they had
forgotten now made itself felt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand Jernyngham,&#8221; Prescott said
after a while. &#8220;One can&#8217;t blame him for persecuting
me, but there&#8217;s something in his conduct that makes one
think him off his balance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel&#8217;s eyes sparkled with indignation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose he ought to be pitied, but I can&#8217;t forgive
him, and I&#8217;ll tell you what I think. He has led a well-regulated
life, but his virtues are narrow and petty.
Indeed, I think they&#8217;re partly habits. He is not a clever
or a really strong man; but because of his money and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
position, which he never ventured out of, he found
people to obey him and grew into a domineering autocrat.
I believe he was fond of Cyril and felt what he thought
of as his loss; but that was not all. The shock brought
him a kind of horrified anger that anything of a startling
nature should happen to him&mdash;he felt it wasn&#8217;t what he
deserved. Then his desire for justice degenerated into
cruelty and when he came out here, where nobody gave
way to him, he somehow went to pieces. His nature
wasn&#8217;t big enough to stand the strain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a harsh analysis, but Muriel was not inclined
to be charitable. Jernyngham had made things very
hard for her lover.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say you&#8217;re right,&#8221; responded Prescott. &#8220;But
the morning after he reached my place in the blizzard
I had a talk with him and found him reasonable. I
think he half believed in my innocence, but soon afterward
he was more savage than before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it possible that you took too much for granted?
He couldn&#8217;t be rude to you when you had saved him
from freezing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I did. He was pretty candid at first
and I wasn&#8217;t cordial, but he listened to me, and I feel
convinced that before he left he was beginning to see
that he might have been mistaken. What I don&#8217;t
understand is why he changed again, when nothing
fresh turned up to account for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A light dawned on Muriel. She saw Gertrude&#8217;s
work in this and her face flushed with anger, but it was
not a subject she meant to discuss with the man she loved.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s scarcely likely that you will
learn the truth. After all, much of Jernyngham&#8217;s
conduct can&#8217;t be explained.&#8221; She smiled at Prescott.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
&#8220;If he&#8217;d had any reason in him, he would never have
doubted you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They turned back to the homestead presently and on
reaching it Prescott found that Colston had arrived.
The latter gave him an interview in the barn, which
was the only place where they could be alone, and
listened with a thoughtful air to what he had to say.
This included an account of his meeting with Laxton
and the pursuit of Wandle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in an unfortunate position,&#8221; Colston remarked
when Prescott had finished. &#8220;You see, every prudential
consideration urges me to oppose you&mdash;looked at from
that point of view the match is most undesirable&mdash;but I
must admit my sympathy with you, and I don&#8217;t suppose
my opposition would have much effect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Prescott replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; Colston resumed, &#8220;I have no real authority;
Muriel&#8217;s of age and she has no property. Still, I&#8217;m fond
of the girl and am anxious about her future. I think
you ought to satisfy me that you&#8217;re able to take care of
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott gave him a concise account of his means, his
farming operations, and his plans for the future; and
Colston listened with satisfaction. The man was more
prosperous than he had supposed and had carefully
considered what could be done to secure the comfort
of his wife; his schemes included the rebuilding of his
house. It was obvious that Muriel need not suffer
greatly from the change. Moreover, Colston had liked
Prescott from the beginning and had found it hard to
distrust him, even when appearances were blackest
against him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All this,&#8221; he said frankly, &#8220;is a relief to me. But
there&#8217;s another and more important point.&#8221; He paused
a moment before he continued: &#8220;To my mind your
name is cleared, but you must agree that the mystery
isn&#8217;t unraveled yet. Although I have no power to
interfere, Muriel is my wife&#8217;s sister and I think she owes
my views some deference. Neither of us can countenance
an engagement or your meeting Muriel often while a
doubt remains. The matter must stand over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must yield to that; you have been more liberal
than I could have expected.&#8221; Then Prescott smiled.
&#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing which could really clear me&mdash;the
reappearance of my victim; and I don&#8217;t despair of it.
The police are trying to trace him on the Pacific Slope,
but it would be quite in accordance with his character if
he suddenly turned up here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went out together, shivering a little, for the barn
was very cold, but they were on friendly terms and were
mutually satisfied.

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>PRESCOTT&#8217;S VINDICATION</h3>
</div>

<p>On the day after Prescott&#8217;s avowal, Muriel found
Gertrude alone and sat down opposite her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you ought to insist on your father&#8217;s
going home?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;The strain is wearing him
out; he may lose his reason if he stays.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude looked up sharply. There was no sympathy
in the girl&#8217;s tone and her eyes were hard. Muriel might
have forgiven a wrong done to herself, but she was
merciless about an injury to one she loved.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed Gertrude. &#8220;You wish to get rid
of us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; my suggestion was really generous, because I
would much rather you both remained and saw Mr.
Prescott proved innocent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Not knowing what had prompted her rival, Gertrude
gave her jealous anger rein.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we couldn&#8217;t wait. Even my father&#8217;s
patience would hardly hold out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be long tried; but in a way you&#8217;re right.
It&#8217;s dangerous for him to stay here, and you&#8217;re responsible
for his condition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m responsible?&#8221; cried Gertrude with a start.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course! You knew Mr. Prescott went away to
look for your brother and you kept it secret; when he
saved your father from freezing, he almost convinced
him that he had nothing to do with Cyril&#8217;s disappearance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
You must have known how it would have eased his mind
to get rid of his dreadful suspicions, but you worked upon
him and brought them back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude sank down in her chair with a shiver. A
denial would serve no purpose and she was conscious of
her guilt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you expect me to be indifferent to the loss of
my brother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew you had not lost him. You believed what
Mr. Prescott told you, until we came.&#8221; Muriel flushed
and hesitated, for this was as far as she would go. Even
in her anger, she would not taunt her beaten rival with
defeat. &#8220;Now,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;you must see what you
have done. You have made your father suffer terribly;
I think you have weakened his mind, and, if I hadn&#8217;t
turned the pistol, you would have made him kill an innocent
man. He seems too dazed and shaken to realize
what he meant to do, but the thing was horrible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude sat silent for a few moments, her face drawn
and colorless. Then she looked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t see what it would lead to. Do the others
know what you have told me? Does Mr. Prescott?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked crushed and defenseless and Muriel&#8217;s
resentment softened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Nobody knows, and Mr. Prescott
will never suspect; he&#8217;s not the man to think hard things
of a woman. But I&#8217;m going to insist on your taking
your father away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can I?&#8221; cried Gertrude. &#8220;You know how
determined he is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have influenced him already; you must do so
again. You will regret it all your life if you let him
stay.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Gertrude promised desperately, &#8220;I will try.&#8221;
Then a thought struck her and her expression grew
gentler. &#8220;Muriel, have you realized that if we leave here
soon, the Colstons will accompany us and you will have
to go with them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Muriel replied with a resolute smile; &#8220;I will
stay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude turned her head and there was silence for a
while. Then she said with an effort:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t ask your forgiveness; it would be too much,
and I&#8217;m not sure that I wish to have it. But I feel that
you are generous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your father home,&#8221; Muriel responded, and
getting up went quietly out.
</p>
<p>During the next fortnight, Gertrude exerted all her
powers of persuasion, without much success. Jernyngham
was apathetic, moody, and morose, and his companions
found the days pass heavily. Then one evening
Prescott drove over with the excuse of a message for
Leslie, and Muriel, putting on her furs, slipped out to
speak to him before he left. They stood near the barn,
talking softly, until there was a pause and Muriel looked
out across the prairie. It was a clear, cold evening; a
dull red glow blazed above the great plain&#8217;s rim, and the
bluffs stood out in wavy masses with sharp distinctness.
The snow had lost its glitter and was fading into soft
blues and grays.
</p>
<p>The darker line of the trail caught the girl&#8217;s eye and,
following it, she noticed a horseman riding toward the
homestead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody has been here for a while,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
wonder who it can be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott&#8217;s team, which had been growing impatient of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
the cold, began to move, and he was occupied for the
next minute in quieting them. Then he looked around,
started violently, and stood very still, his eyes fixed on
the approaching man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jernyngham, by all that&#8217;s wonderful!&#8221; he gasped,
and sent a shout ringing across the snow: &#8220;Cyril!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man waved his hand, and Prescott, turning at a
sound, saw Muriel lean weakly against the side of the
sleigh. The color had faded from her face, but her eyes
were shining.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O Jack!&#8221; she said breathlessly. &#8220;Now everything
will be put straight!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott realized from the greatness of her relief what
she had borne on his account; but there was something
that must be done and he ran to the stable, where Leslie
was at work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get into my sleigh, and drive to Harper&#8217;s as hard as
you can!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Curtis was there when I passed;
bring him here at once!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie came out with him and understood when he saw
the newcomer. Jumping into the vehicle, he drove off,
while Prescott ran to meet Cyril, who dismounted and
heartily shook hands with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to see you, Jack,&#8221; he said, and indicated
the galloping team. &#8220;The sensation I seem to make
shows no signs of lessening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you heard!&#8221; Prescott exclaimed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; Cyril replied with a careless laugh.
&#8220;When I got off the train at the settlement, everybody
stared at me, and there were anxious inquiries as to
where I&#8217;d been. I promised to tell them about it another
time, and at the livery-stable Kevan said something about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
my being killed. I told him it didn&#8217;t look like it; and as
the boys seemed determined on hearing my adventures;
I rode off smartly. When I reached your place, Svendsen
looked scared, and all I could get out of him was that you
were here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott made a gesture of comprehension. It was
typical of Cyril that he had not taken the trouble to
find out the cause of the excitement his appearance had
aroused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the lady?&#8221; Cyril asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Hurst. You had, perhaps, better know that
she has promised to marry me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cyril looked at him in frank astonishment, and then
laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose my surprise isn&#8217;t complimentary, but I
wasn&#8217;t prepared for your news. Jack, you&#8217;re rather
wonderful, but you have my best wishes, and you can
tell me what brought Miss Hurst back by and by. No
doubt she expects me to speak to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Prescott dryly. &#8220;Whatever my capabilities
of making a sensation are, they&#8217;re a long way
behind yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They walked toward the girl and Prescott led up his
companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Muriel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Cyril Jernyngham wishes to be
presented to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She gave him her hand, and he realized that she was
studying him carefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we have met,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have heard a
good deal about you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cyril bowed with a mischievous smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing very much to my credit, I&#8217;m afraid. As an
old friend of Jack&#8217;s, it&#8217;s my privilege to wish you every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
happiness and assure you that you have got a much better
man than the one you at first took him for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muriel colored.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack stands on his own merits.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she turned to Prescott.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he know? Have you told him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet. I&#8217;ve news for you, Cyril. Your father and
sister are here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What brought them?&#8221; There was astonishment in
Cyril&#8217;s face, but he looked more disturbed than pleased.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They thought you dead,&#8221; Muriel told him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m sorry if they&#8217;ve been anxious, but I can&#8217;t
understand the grounds for it. In fact, everybody I&#8217;ve
met seems to have gone crazy, except you and Jack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew the truth,&#8221; said Muriel. &#8220;There are a
number of explanations you will have to make, but you
had better go in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next moment the door opened and Gertrude
appeared, as if in search of Muriel. She saw the group
and broke into a startled cry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyril!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He ran toward her and Prescott suggested that it might
be advisable for him to retire, but Muriel would not agree.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give them a few minutes, Jack, and then we&#8217;ll go
in together; you are one of us now and must be acknowledged.
Besides, you have a right to hear what Cyril
has to say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They walked briskly up the trail and when they turned
to come back Muriel glanced at Prescott with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack dear, I like him, but he said something that was
true. I should never have fallen in love with the real
Cyril Jernyngham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They found the others in the large sitting-room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
Cyril was talking gaily, though Prescott concluded from
one remark that he had not yet given a full account of
his adventures. Jernyngham sat rather limply in an
easy-chair, as if the relief of finding his son safe had shaken
him, but his eyes were less troubled and his manner
calmer. He rose when he saw Prescott.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Prescott,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I must own before these
others, who have heard me speak hardly of you, that I
have done you a grievous wrong. I have no excuse to
urge in asking you to forgive it. There is nothing that
now seems to mitigate my folly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All you thought and did was very natural, sir,&#8221;
Prescott answered quietly. &#8220;I tried not to blame you
and I feel no resentment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; Cyril glanced up sharply, and as
he noticed the guilty faces of the others and Gertrude&#8217;s
strained expression, the truth dawned on him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;it&#8217;s preposterous! You all suspected
my best friend!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s any consolation, we&#8217;re very much ashamed
of it,&#8221; Colston replied. &#8220;And there was one exception;
Muriel never shared our views.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cyril still looked disturbed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Its obvious that I&#8217;ve given everybody a good deal of
trouble, but I feel that you deserved it for your foolishness.
May I ask on what grounds you suspected Jack?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Seeing that none of them was ready to answer, Prescott
interposed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I had better explain; I think you ought to
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He related the events that had followed his friend&#8217;s
disappearance, and when he had finished, Cyril turned to
the others.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></p>
<p>&#8220;After all, you were not so much to blame as I thought
at first&mdash;you don&#8217;t know Jack as I do, and things undoubtedly
looked bad. Now I&#8217;ll give you an account of
my adventures and clear up the mystery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; said Prescott with a smile. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
seem to realize that instead of excusing people for suspicions
they could hardly avoid, you&#8217;re expected to make
some defense for the carelessness that gave rise to them.
Anyway, Curtis is entitled to an explanation, and as I
sent him word, he should be here soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did right,&#8221; Jernyngham broke in with a trace of
asperity. &#8220;It&#8217;s proper that the blundering fellow who
misled us all should have his stupidity impressed on
him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They waited, talking about indifferent matters, until
Curtis arrived. At Cyril&#8217;s request he made a rough
diagram of the tracks he had discovered in the neighborhood
of the muskeg and stated his theory of what
had happened there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A clever piece of reasoning,&#8221; Cyril remarked.
&#8220;There&#8217;s scarcely a flaw in it, as you&#8217;ll see by my account
of the affair. After saying good-by to Prescott
on the night I left the settlement, I went on until I was
near the muskeg and had dismounted to camp when a
stranger rode up. We sat talking for a while and I
foolishly told him I meant to buy some horses and apply
for a railroad haulage contract, from which he no doubt
concluded I was carrying some money. Soon afterward,
he went off to hobble his horse, and I suppose he must
have crept up behind me and knocked me out with the
handle of his quirt, for I fell over with a stupefying pain
in my head. This was the last thing I was clearly conscious
of until the next morning, when I found myself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
lying close to the water, but at some distance from
where I met the man. My hat had gone and my head
was cut; my horse had disappeared, and I afterward
discovered I had been robbed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cyril paused and glanced at Curtis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a point to be accounted for&mdash;how I reached
the spot where I was lying, and this is my suggestion: The
fellow thought he had killed me and in alarm determined
to throw me into the muskeg. As I had a hazy recollection
of being roughly lifted, I imagine he laid me across
his saddle and after a while I must have moved or
groaned. Then, having no doubt only meant to stun me,
he left me on the ground. All this fits in with your
theory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was the man like?&#8221; Curtis asked.
</p>
<p>Cyril described him, explaining that there was a good
moon; and the corporal nodded, as if satisfied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m glad to say that, as I half expected, we
have got the fellow; corralled him for horse-stealing a
while ago, and he&#8217;ll be charged with robbing you in due
time. But go on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt horribly thirsty, and crawling to the edge of
the sloo, tumbled in. There was more slime than water,
but I could see a cleaner pool some way out, and being
up to my knees already, I tried to reach it. It was
hardly fit to drink, but I felt better and clearer-headed
after swallowing some; and then I noticed thick grass in
front of me. This implied that the swamp was shallower
there and I made for the other bank, instead of going
back. The grass and reeds that I disturbed would soon
straighten, which accounts for your losing my tracks.
You wouldn&#8217;t have expected me to wade across the
muskeg?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted Curtis; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you not return to Sebastian after being
robbed of your horse and money?&#8221; Jernyngham
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Cyril with some constraint in his manner,
&#8220;that&#8217;s more difficult to explain. To some extent it
was a matter of temperament. I had left the settlement
after a painful and rather humiliating discovery; you can
understand that I was anxious to avoid my neighbors.
Then I&#8217;d been knocked out and robbed by the first
rascal I fell in with. I hadn&#8217;t the courage to crawl back
in my battered state and face the boys&#8217; amusement;
and there was something that appealed to me in the
thought of cutting loose and going on without a dollar,
to see what I could do.&#8221; He smiled at his father and
sister. &#8220;You know I had always rather eccentric ideas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he recounted his adventures along the railroad
under the name of Kermode, until Prescott interrupted
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I followed you to the abandoned claim in the mountains,
where I had to give it up. How did you make out
after you struck south with the prospector crank?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the most interesting part of the trip, but I
could hardly describe it. We crawled up icy rocks, found
a river we could travel on here and there, scrambled
through brush that ripped our clothes and over stones
that cut our boots to bits, and finally came down by
Quesnelle to the Canadian Pacific main track.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Loaded with worthless mineral specimens?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cyril laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were pretty heavy, Jack. Once or twice I
thought of dumping my share of them, but it&#8217;s fortunate
that Hollin, who seemed to suspect my intentions, kept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
his eye on me when I got played out. You see, an
assayer we took them to found that they were rich in
lead and silver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott&#8217;s astonishment was obvious and Cyril frankly
enjoyed it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the end of it was that I called on
some of the mining people in Vancouver&mdash;it seems they
knew Hollin and had had enough of him&mdash;but I left one
office with a check for a thousand dollars, besides retaining
an interest in the claim. Hollin has gone back to
see about its development.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His father and sister looked as surprised as Prescott.
One could imagine that they found it difficult to conceive
of Cyril&#8217;s financial success, but they offered him their
congratulations, and soon afterward Curtis took his
leave. Prescott stayed another hour, and when he went
Muriel walked to the door with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; she murmured, with her head on his shoulder,
&#8220;I&#8217;m inexpressibly glad it has all come right; but you
must remember that I knew it would.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott gently turned her face toward him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so thankful that it makes me grave. It&#8217;s a
pretty big task to repay your confidence, but I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll succeed,&#8221; she said smiling. &#8220;You&#8217;re rather
a determined man and I&#8217;m not dreadfully exacting;
I couldn&#8217;t be to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott drove off, grateful for Mrs. Colston&#8217;s permission
to come back the next day.
</p>
<p>When he drove up on the following afternoon, he
found Muriel dressed in furs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beautifully fine and you may take me for a
drive,&#8221; she said, and added with a smile: &#8220;That is,
unless you would rather talk to Harry.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think Colston and I are going to be good friends,
but I didn&#8217;t come over to see him,&#8221; Prescott retorted
lightly. &#8220;I have something to say to Cyril, but it will
do when we get back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t see him now,&#8221; said Muriel, moving
toward the sleigh. &#8220;He&#8217;s engaged with Gertrude and
his father, and I think they have something important
to talk about. Cyril looked very serious, and one
would imagine that&#8217;s not often the case with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prescott laughed as he helped her in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say he has his thoughtful moments; it would
be surprising if he hadn&#8217;t, considering his capacity for
getting into scrapes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They drove away, but Muriel&#8217;s supposition was well
founded, for Cyril was feeling unusually grave as he
sat opposite to his father and sister in a room of the homestead.
A brief silence had fallen upon the group,
emphasized by the crackle of poplar billets in the stove.
Jernyngham, in whose appearance there had been a
marked improvement since his son&#8217;s return, wore an
eager expression; Gertrude was watching her brother
with troubled eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have heard my suggestions about your return
to England,&#8221; Jernyngham said at length. &#8220;I think
they are fair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are generous,&#8221; Cyril answered, and added
slowly: &#8220;But I cannot go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham leaned back in his chair as if he were
weary, with keen disappointment in his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no other son, Cyril. We will wipe out the
past&mdash;there is something to regret on both sides&mdash;and
try to make everything pleasant for you. I feel that you
ought to come.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Cyril persisted with signs of strain. &#8220;I&#8217;m
strongly tempted, but it would not be wise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham looked hard at him and then made a
sign of resignation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will, at least, give us your reasons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try, though I&#8217;m not sure you will understand
them; it&#8217;s unfortunate we&#8217;re so different that we cannot
find a common viewpoint from which to look at things.
I believe I&#8217;ve overcome what bitterness I once felt, but
in all that&#8217;s essential I haven&#8217;t changed. After the first
few weeks, I should jar on you, or I should have to be
continually on my guard, until the repression got too
much for me and the inevitable outbreak came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should there be an outbreak?&#8221; his father asked
with some asperity.
</p>
<p>Cyril glanced at Gertrude, noticing her rather weary
smile, and fancied that she could sympathize with him,
which was more than he had expected. She had somehow
gained comprehension in Canada.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I must explain. I&#8217;m not thinking of my
worst faults, but, you see, I&#8217;m a careless trifler, impatient
of restraint. To have to do things in stereotyped
order distresses me; I must go where my fancy leads.
When I&#8217;m cooped up and confined, I feel I must break
loose, even if it leads to havoc.&#8221; He laughed. &#8220;Of
course, such a frame of mind is beyond your imagining.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must confess that it is,&#8221; Jernyngham replied dryly.
</p>
<p>Gertrude cast a half-applauding glance at her brother.
With all his failings, which she recognized and deplored,
Cyril was to her something of a romantic hero. He took
risks, and did daring and perhaps somewhat discreditable
things, but, narrow as her decorous life had been, she
envied his reckless gallantry. Once she had ventured to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
break through the safe rules of conduct and grasp at
romance, but it had eluded her and left her humiliation
and regret. She must go back to the dreary routine
wherein lay security, but she admired him for standing
out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Cyril, &#8220;I&#8217;m talking at large; but we must
thrash out the matter once for all. I may do something
useful here&mdash;make wheat grow; perhaps help in developing
the mine&mdash;which I couldn&#8217;t do at home.&#8221; He
paused and concluded whimsically: &#8220;It&#8217;s even possible
that I may turn into a successful rancher.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that means working like an English field
laborer!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For a higher pay. When the crop escapes drought
and frost, and there&#8217;s no hail or rust, western farming&#8217;s
fairly profitable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In short,&#8221; said Jernyngham, &#8220;you have made up
your mind not to come home with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry it is so,&#8221; Cyril responded gravely. &#8220;Try
to understand. If I stay here, we will be good friends
and you will think well of me. If I go home there will
be trouble and regret for you. I want to save you that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; Gertrude broke in softly, &#8220;though it&#8217;s hard
to say, I know that Cyril&#8217;s right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jernyngham got up wearily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing more that I can urge. You must
do as you think best, my son, but while I shall never quite
grasp your point of view, you will always be in our
thoughts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were glad to separate, for the interview had been
trying to them all.
</p>
<p>Some time had passed when Cyril, hearing a beat of
hoofs, went out and found Prescott pulling up his team.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We have been talking over matters while you were
out,&#8221; he told him. &#8220;As I&#8217;ve decided to stay here, my
people are going home soon&mdash;in a week or two, I think;
and I expect Colston will leave with them. I thought
you might like to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He saw the color creep into Muriel&#8217;s face; and when he
turned back to the house Prescott lifted the girl down
from the sleigh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear, I can&#8217;t let them take you away,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Muriel glanced across the snowy plain to the blaze of
fading color upon its western rim. It was growing shadowy,
the woods were blurred and vague, but its wideness
fired her imagination and she felt the exhilaration that
was in the nipping air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; she smiled up at him, &#8220;my home is here!
I&#8217;m learning to love the prairie, and it has brought me
happiness. I&#8217;m glad to stay with you!&#8221;
</p>
